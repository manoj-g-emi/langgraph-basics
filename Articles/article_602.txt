Heading: Johnson Johnson ordered to pay 55 mln in talc powder tri

Article: strong>NEW YORK: Johnson &amp; Johnson was ordered by a US jury on Monday to pay $55 million to a woman who said that using the company´s talc-powder products for feminine hygiene caused her to develop ovarian cancer.</strongThe verdict is the second straight trial loss for the company, which is facing approximately 1,200 lawsuits accusing it of not adequately warning consumers about its talc-based products´ cancer risks.Following a three-week trial in Missouri state court, jurors deliberated for about a day before returning a verdict in favor of plaintiff Gloria Ristesund.J&amp;J spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc. The company intends to appeal the jury´s decision and will continue defending its products´ safety, she said.Ristesund said she used J&amp;J´s talc-based powder products  which include the well-known Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder  on her genitals for decades. According to her lawyers, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a hysterectomy and related surgeries.The verdict follows a $72 million jury award from the same court in February to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer after years of using talc powder for feminine hygiene.Plaintiffs in talc litigation, which is concentrated in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, have accused J&amp;J of failing for years to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer.J&amp;J has said that it acted properly in developing and marketing the products.
