Yes, it did happen during 2004 when we were playing a Test in Rawalpindi. But it was nothing serious and all fun," Akhtar clarified."Basically we were doing some arm wrestling and that is all," Akhtar said. Harbhajan narrated the incident during a show on an Indian television channel and his claims were highlighted by Pakistani media.Harbhajan said  in an Indian Tv show that former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar was a player with whom he often had spat with though they were friends off the field.Shoaib abused me a lot. He used to sit with us, ate with us. Since he was too close to us, maybe he used to take us for granted. He challenged me once to hit a six and when I hit a six, he was shocked. He then bowled two consecutive bouncers which I evaded. He then abused me and I replied back. But after the game, we sat together as if nothing happened.Shoaib once threatened me he would come to my room and beat me. I told him come, lets see who beats whom. I was really scared. He is a great hulk. He once bashed me and Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) inside a room. Since he was heavy, it was difficult to catch him, Harbhajan said.
