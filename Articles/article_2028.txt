Heading: Hend secures victory in Queens Cu

Article: BANGKOK: Australian big hitter Scott Hend overcame a two-shot deficit to snatch victory in the Queen´s Cup on Thailand´s Koh Samui island on Sunday as overnight leader Prom Meesawat stumbled.The 42-year-old finished the day with a four-under-par 67, one shot ahead of runner-up and local talent Gunn Charoenkul in the $300,000 competition at the Santiburi Samui Country Club.It was Hend´s second title of the season and his ninth career victory on the Asian Tour.Hend, the most successful international player on the tour, said he was pleased to make up for some recent near-wins in Mauritius and China."Whether this was my golf course or not, I´ve been playing very good golf and trying to not get down on myself. It´s nice to win again," he said, according to a report by tour organisers.Two late bogeys saw Thailand´s Prom go from starting the day out in front to ending with a disappointing 72.He finished in joint third alongside American Paul Peterson, Korea´s Wang Jeung-hun and Thailand´s Pavit Tangkamolprasert.
