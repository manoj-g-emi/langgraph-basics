Heading: Konta stuns Allertova to march into last 16 at Australian O

Article: MELBOURNE:  Johanna Konta marches on in the Australian Open, her excellent game buttressed by that weird, metronomic serve and embellished by a high-powered cross-court forehand that was too much for Denisa Allertova on Hisense Arena on Saturday.The British No1 closed out an impressive 6-2, 6-2 win to advance to the fourth round, and she now has realistic chances of going deep into the second week after a string of seeds went out in the first five days of the tournament.Allertova extended her as far as she could, but could not resist the precision of Kontas serve, and the job was done when Konta slammed another neat forehand to her feet, forcing a final error after 64 minutes.From here, it gets a little harder. Konta will meet the Russian No21 seed, Ekaterina Makarova, after she eliminated No9 seed Karolina Pliskova.On this showing and her earlier efforts, Konta is now a serious danger to the higher seeds in her first Australian Open. To reach the last eight would be an extraordinary effort; she would be the first British player to make the quarter-finals of a slam since Jo Durie at Wimbledon in 1984.
