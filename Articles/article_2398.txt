Heading: Pak batsmen will have to show patience Saqlai

Article: strong>ISLAMABAD: Former off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq feels that Pakistan batsmen will have to show patience and stay on the crease if they want to put reasonable score on the board against England in the ongoing third Test in Birmingham.</strongTechnically English batsmen are very sound. They can also stay at the wicket and play long innings. If they faced problems against Pakistan pacers in their first innings, then Pakistan batsmen too can face difficulties, he said.Saqlains services were hired by England as spin consultant for the second Test at the Old Trafford Test. His suggestions paid dividends as the English batsmen first tackled Yasir Shah efficiently before their spinner Moeen Ali caused troubles for the Pakistani batters.Saqlain was also of the opinion that Yasir Shah would earn repute if he managed to bounce back in the ongoing Test from his poor show in the second Test.
