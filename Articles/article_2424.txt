Heading: Englands Hales refunds unhappy f

Article: strong>BIRMINGHAM: England opener Alex Hales has given a partial refund to a spectator who complained about the slow over-rate during the the ongoing third Test against Pakistan at Edgbaston.</strongBetween them, England and Pakistan only managed to bowl 81 of a scheduled 90 overs on Friday´s third day.The fault mainly lay with England, who fell behind the rate early on and left Pakistan with a marathon 44 overs to bowl in the day´s final session by the time they had dismissed the tourists on the stroke of tea.Unsurprisingly, Pakistan failed to get through all those overs before the scheduled 6:30pm (1730 GMT) cut-off time for close of play.Upset fan Alexis Fuller, who was in the Edgbaston crowd on Friday, contacted several England players to ask for a 10 percent refund after Michael Vaughan, the former England captain, pointed out that only 81 overs had been bowled."I want 10% of my money back," Fuller wrote. "Wouldn´t go to football and find it ended after 80mins."Hales, who was 50 not out at stumps, following an unbroken 120-run stand with England captain Alastair Cook, replied saying: "ok DM me your bank details I´ll do it now".Fuller after posted a picture on social media that appeared to show a payment of £4.10 from Hales into his account.Fans attending Edgbaston on Saturday saw Hales bat for less than 10 percent of the day´s play after he was out for 54 in the fifth over of the morning to leave England 126 for two in their second innings.
