Heading: Australia batsman Warner has fractured finger

Article: St. KITTS: Australia vice-captain David Warner has a fractured left index finger, the team announced on Sunday.Opening batsman Warner suffered the injury while fielding during Saturday´s victory over South Africa in the triangular one-day series in St Kitts."We will assess the situation over the coming days to see if the injury requires a surgical option but should that not be the case then David is likely to be available to return to play in somewhere between two and six weeks," team doctor Geoffrey Verrall said in a statement.The final of the triangular contest, which also includes the host West Indies, will be played on June 26, which seems to rule Warner out for the rest of the series.The injury comes as the left-hander is in some of the best form of his career.Warner was named man of the match on Saturday after completing his first ODI century outside Australia, a knock of 109 off 120 balls at the appropriately-named Warner Park.Just two weeks ago he captained Sunrisers Hyderabad to victory in the final of the Indian Premier League.Warner is looking at the positives of his enforced absence after a busy stretch of cricket."It´s obviously disappointing to be sidelined given the form I´ve been in (but this) will give me the chance to freshen up and spend quality time with my family after an intense period of action."Australia lead the triangular series with two victories from three games.<br/> They next meet West Indies in St Kitts on Monday.
