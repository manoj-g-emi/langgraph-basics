Heading: Mohsin stars in Pakistans big triumph against N

Article: FATULLAH:  Hasan Mohsin first scored 106-ball 117 and then took four for 42 to help Pakistan U-19 team record a convincing 122-run win against Nepal U-19 in the fifth-place playoff semi-final of the ICC Under-19 World Cup 2016 here at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium on Tuesday.After Pakistan lost the toss and made 258 for 8, Nepal was bowled out for 136 in 43.5 overs.A day after losing the Super League quarter-final against West Indies at the same venue, Pakistan started on a shaky note, Aarif Sheikh´s twin strikes reducing it to 3 for 2 in 4.3 overs. Soon, that became 30 for 3 before Saif Badar found the perfect ally in Mohsin.The duo put on 189 runs for the fourth wicket in 31.1 overs before Badar fell to Sandeep Lamichhane, the leg-spinner, in the 45th over. Badar´s patient 88 came off 118 deliveries with six fours and a six.Lamichhane, the only bowler with a hat-trick in this edition, struck twice more. He had Mohsin caught by Dipendra Airee in his next over for a sparkling knock that contained eight fours and three sixes.Two balls later, Lamichhane accounted for Salman Fayyaz, who had been involved in the highest sixth-wicket partnership in the history of Youth One-Day Internationals with Umair Masood in the loss against West Indies.Pakistan added 20 runs after Fayyaz´s dismissal, but already had enough on the board.<br/> <br/> Starting its chase, Nepal lost five wickets in the first ten overs for 29 and never recovered from thereon.Apart from Mohsin´s four-wicket burst, Irfan Liaqat and Saif Ali picked up two wickets each to put a swift end to the game.While Pakistan will take on the winner of the England-Namibia game to decide the fifth place, Nepal will play the loser of that match to decide the seventh-placed team.
