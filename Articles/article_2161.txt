Heading: Younis eyes century as Amir wai

Article: strong>Taunton: Younis Khan made an unbeaten 99 while Mohammad Amir was left waiting in the wings as Pakistan launched their tour of England with 324 for five on the opening day of three against Somerset on Sunday.</strongThis was Pakistan´s first first-class match on English soil since their controversial "spot-fixing" tour of 2010.During that year´s Test against England at Lord´s, Amir and Pakistan new-ball partner Mohammad Asif bowled no-balls to order on the instructions of their captain Salman Butt as part of a sting operation carried out by a tabloid newspaper.All three received five-year bans from cricket and, together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms.<br/>However, Amir returned to international cricket earlier this year and could make his Test comeback at Lord´s, where Pakistan face England in the first of a four-Test series from July 14.Although selected for the Somerset match, his return to action in England was delayed when Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq won the toss and batted."He´s prepared very well," said Younis of Amir, after stumps at southwest county Somerset´s Taunton headquarters."If he can perform against England, a top team, it will be very nice for him. "Pakistan need him to bowl well and he´s shown what kind of character he has."/><strong>´Happy man of the earth´</strongExperienced 38-year-old batsman Younis, who has had spells with several English teams including reigning county champions Yorkshire, added: "Any teams that come to England struggle against their bowling attack here."We know it won´t be easy, but we are prepared. "It would be very fantastic for me (to win the series).<br/>"If I perform, I will be the happy man of the earth." After Misbah fell for a duck, Younis and Asad Shafiq (80) shared a fifth-wicket stand of 179.Pakistan opener Mohammad Hafeez made a lively start as he hooked Somerset and Scotland paceman Josh Davey over fine leg and pulled him over mid-wicket for two sixes in as many balls.But Dutch bowler Paul van Meekeren, who only joined Somerset last week, made the breakthrough when he bowled Hafeez for 20.Pakistan were 79 for one at lunch but lost three wickets in the second session against Somerset´s multi-national attack that also featured a South African in paceman Tim Groenewald.Azhar Ali (20) was well caught by diving wicket-keeper Alex Barrow off van Meekeren. Left-handed opener Shan Masood, missed on 17 and 39, batted attractively until he was lbw to Groenewald for 62.Two balls later Groenewald had Misbah out for a duck with the aid of a fine slip catch by Tim Rouse.<br/>The luckless Davey went wicketless after former England batsman Marcus Trescothick dropped a tough slip catch when Younis was on 20.Younis went to fifty when he swept off-spinner Dom Bess, making his first-class debut, for a seventh four in 105 balls.Shafiq also went to the landmark with his seventh four, but in 69 balls, when he late-cut left-arm spinner Jack Leach.There was more bad luck for Davey when Younis´s inside edge on 75 evaded the diving Barrow.<br/>Shafiq´s 120-ball innings ended when he was well caught by Bess at point off Leach.It seemed Younis would get to his 53rd first-class century before stumps. But instead he was left one run shy of a hundred, with Sarfraz Ahmed (six not out) unable to get off strike.This fixture is Pakistan´s first of two three-day games before the first Test at Lord´s, with the Pakistanis also playing Sussex at Hove from July 8-10.
