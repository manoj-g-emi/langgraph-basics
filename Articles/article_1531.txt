Heading: West Indies knock India out of Womens World T20

Article: MOHALI: Not even the support of a festive home crowd and conditions they thrive could inspire India Women as they slumped to a three-run loss to West Indies Women in Mohali.The defeat brought the curtains down on India's disappointing World Twenty20 campaign.Jhulan Goswami, who bowled all of two overs on a slow surface, kept India alive with a few lusty blows that brought the equation down to 20 off the last two overs.Tension engulfed the PCA Stadium, but a crowd that was on tenterhooks roared in delight as the third ball of the penultimate over sailed over long-on to bring it down to 12 off nine balls.But her run-out off the next delivery, once again, meant the pendulum swung West Indies' way. Deandra Dottin, who ensured West Indies were in with a chance by making 45 off 40 balls in the team's total of 114 for 8, then showed immaculate death-bowling skills to leave India short-changed.Shikha Pandey, who carved a boundary over point to bring it down to five off three balls was run-out off the next delivery to effectively dash India's hopes.India landed the early punches and weakened West Indies to 26 for 3 as the contest was reduced to a battle of spin attacks.The hosts then switched off for a bit, only to see Stafanie Taylor and Dottin regain lost ground, and then lift West Indies with a fourth-wicket partnership of 77.The stand helped West Indies post a total of 114 for 8, challenging, but by no means impossible.
