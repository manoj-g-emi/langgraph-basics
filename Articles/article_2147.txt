Heading: Djokovic facing Wimbledon humiliation Serena Venus surviv

Article: LONDON: World number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic was facing Wimbledon humiliation on Friday before rain saved him from his worst defeat at the tournament since 2008.The three-time champion, who is already halfway to the first calendar Grand Slam in 47 years, dropped the first two sets of his third round clash against American 28th seed Sam Querrey 7-6 (8/6), 6-1.But after just 73 minutes of action, rain sent them running for cover off Court One, giving 12-time major winner Djokovic welcome sanctuary before play was called off for the day on the outside courts. By that stage, only 17 of the scheduled 32 ties had been completed.Djokovic, who has an 8-1 record over Querrey, has made at least the quarter-finals on his last seven visits to Wimbledon since losing to Marat Safin in the second round eight years ago.He has also made the last eight of each of the last 28 Grand Slams since losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round of the 2009 French Open.Meanwhile, Serena and Venus Williams survived marathon duels as the rain, which has plagued the tournament, forced organisers to consider playing on the middle Sunday for the first time since 2004.World number one and defending champion Serena defeated US compatriot Christina McHale 6-7 (7/9), 6-2, 6-4 on Centre Court, only just avoiding what would have been her earliest-ever Wimbledon defeat.The six-time Wimbledon champion will face Germany´s Annika Beck for a place in the last 16.
