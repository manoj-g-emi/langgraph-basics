"West Australia have some talented young fast-bowlers that have developed under Adam´s watch and it´s great to be able to offer him the chance to work with the Australian side under Justin Langer."Australia are looking for a full time bowling coach after former international quick Craig McDermott stepped down following the World Twenty20 tournament in India earlier this month.The 38-year-old Griffith played 50 first class matches for Tasmania as a right-arm fast-medium bowler but his career was curtailed with serious injuries before he retired in 2010 and took up a coaching role at Western Australia in 2011."The opportunity to work with Australia´s premium bowlers is incredibly exciting," Griffith said.
