Heading: Nadal pulls out of French Open with wrist injury

Article: strong>PARIS: Nine-times French Open champion Rafael Nadal unexpectedly pulled out of the French Open on Friday because of a left wrist injury.</strong"I have a problem with my wrist... yesterday I played with an injection, I could play but yesterday night I started to feel more and more pain," the Spanish left-hander told reporters in a hurriedly arranged news conference at Roland Garros."Today I felt I could not move my wrist," added the dejected Spaniard, who showed no signs of the injury during his 6-3 6-0 6-3 second round win over Facundo Bagnis on Thursday.This is the latest setback the 29-year-old Spaniard has suffered in an injury-plagued career. Tendinitis in his knees prevented him from defending his Wimbledon title in 2009, while the 2008 Beijing Olympics gold medallist also missed the 2012 London Games because of injury.Nadal said, however, that he hoped he would be fit to play at Wimbledon next month.<br/><br/
