Heading: Englands Buttler suffers thumb fractur

Article: MANCHESTER, UK: England wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler is set for a stint on the sidelines after suffering a fractured thumb, his county side Lancashire said on Sunday.It is not known how long Buttler will be out of action, but having been overlooked by England for the first Test of a four-match series against Pakistan, he will be hoping to return for the limited-overs games in August.The 25-year-old was struck by the bat of Worcestershire opponent Ben Cox while keeping during Lancashire´s T20 Blast win on Friday.Despite that Buttler, who has scored England´s three fastest one-day international hundreds ever, went on to score a match-winning 50 from just 20 balls, the quickest in Lancashire Twenty20 history."X-rays later revealed he sustained a small stable fracture which will be managed conservatively," Lancashire said in a statement.
