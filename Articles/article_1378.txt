Heading: Afghanistan win toss bat against Scotland

Article: NAGPUR:  Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai chose to bat against Scotland in the second match of the opening day of the World T20 in Nagpur. Stanikzai attributed the reason behind his decision to the flat track and his hopes of getting more turn in the second half of the match.Stanikzai said 150 would be a good total to aim for. He picked a spin-heavy attack comprising left-arm spinner Amir Hamza and leg-spinner Rashid Khan, to be followed by Samiullah Shenwari and Mohammad Nabi. The main seamer picked in the XI was Dawlat Zadran as they left out Hamid Hassan and Shapoor Zadran.Scotland's XI, on the other hand, was pace-reliant with Josh Davey, Alasdair Evans and Safyaan Sharif, even as captain Preston Mommsen said he was "not too bothered" about batting second. The lone frontline spinner included was 19-year-old left-arm spinner Mark Watt. Mommsen said they would look to restrict Afghanistan to under 150-160.Afghanistan: Mohammad Shahzad (wk), Noor Ali Zadran, Asghar Stanikzai (captain), Mohammad Nabi, Samiullah Shenwari, Najibullah Zadran, Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Rashid Khan, Shafiqullah, Amir HamzaScotland: Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Matthew Cross (wk), Matt Machan, Richie Berrington, Preston Mommsen (captain), George Munsey, Josh Davey, Safyaan Sharif, Mark Watt, Alasdair Evans
