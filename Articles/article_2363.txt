Heading: Battling Zimbabwe hold New Zealand at bay

Article: BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe: A fighting stand between Sean Williams and Graeme Cremer kept Zimbabwe alive on day four of the first Test against New Zealand in Bulawayo on Sunday.Williams recorded his maiden Test fifty and Cremer resisted the New Zealand bowlers for the entire morning session to take the hosts to lunch on 221 for six at Queens Sports Club.Zimbabwe began the day on 121 for five, still needing 291 runs to make New Zealand bat again, and lost Craig Ervine for 50 in the second over of the day.But fears of another collapse were not realised, as Williams shrugged off the illness that had kept him off the field for the previous two days and took the fight to the tourists.With an attacking field set, the left-hander took advantage of the gaps in the field to hit 15 boundaries in an unbeaten 73 from just 83 deliveries.Cremer´s innings was more about grit, as he weathered several blows to the body from Neil Wagner on his way to 32 not out.Zimbabwe still trailed by 191 runs with four wickets in hand.
