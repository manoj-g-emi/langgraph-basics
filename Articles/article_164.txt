Heading: despite govt announcement cng stations yet to reopen in punjab

Article: LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations, expected to reopen Friday across all cities of Punjab after seven months, were still closed despite announcements by the Punjab and Islamabad governments. The petroleum ministry's negotiations between officials of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Compressed Natural Gas Association had earlier proved successful, with the associations assuring that Punjab CNG stations would reopen on Friday. But CNG stations were yet to reopen in the provincial capital Lahore, with sources saying the delay in reopening of stations related to a dispute over clearing of dues. The SNGPL had allowed station owners to reopen their businesses following advance payment after the gap of almost seven months.According to sources, the SNGPL has informed station owners to submit Rs 1.2 million as security deposit and has resumed supply of gas to stations whose owners have paid the security amount. A similar situation was witness in the federal capital Islamabad at the time of filing of this report. The CNG association says the matter would be resolved and CNG stations reopened by Friday evening.
