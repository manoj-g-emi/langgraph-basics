One of the points was that the PCB needs to hire a sports psychologist to get the players mindset right and get their thinking to be a lot more positive, Pakpassion net quoted him as saying.He said there is too much negativity in the Pakistan dressing room and that needs to be eradicated.The needs to be more self belief amongst our cricketers and that is missing at the moment.The players need to believe more in them and that they can win from any situation which is lacking these days, he said.Azhar said there also needs to be more dedication and hard work from the current crop of Pakistani cricketers as that is also missing.Another point I have made to the PCB is to hire a better quality of domestic coach.
