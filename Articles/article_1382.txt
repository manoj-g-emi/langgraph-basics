Heading: Hong Kong bowl Ryan Campbell debu

Article: NAGPUR: Forty-four-year-old Ryan Campbell became the oldest debutant in T20 internationals as Hong Kong chose to chase in the World T20 opener in Nagpur. Hong Kong have opted to bowl 10 times of the 12 in which they have won the toss, showing a clear preference for knowing their target.Both captains expected the surface to produce plenty of runs and while Hamilton Masakadza would have preferred to bat second as well, he was not too unhappy with the decision.Zimbabwe chose to field what appears their strongest side with Vusi Sibanda and Masakadza at the top, Sikanda Raza in the middle order and senior seamer Tinashe Panyangara to head up the bowlers.Their attack included two others frontline seamers - Tendai Chatara, who recovered from a shin injury, and Donald Tiripano. The four slower options comprised Wellington Masakadza, Malcolm Waller, Sean Williams and Raza.Hong-Kong's line-up would be headed by Babar Hayat, who scored the fourth-fastest hundred in the format, off 50 balls, in the Asia Cup qualifying last month.Zimbabwe: Hamilton Masakadza, Vusi Sibanda, Richmond Mutumbami (wk), Malcolm Waller, Sean Williams, Sikanda Raza, Elton Chigumbura, Donald Tiripano, Tinashe Panyangara, Wellington Masakadza, Tendai ChataraHong Kong: Jamie Atkinson (wk), Ryan Campbell, Babar Hayat, Mark Chapman, Nizakat Khan, Anshuman Rath, Kinchit Shah, Tanwir Afzal (captain), Aizaz Khan, Haseeb Amjad, Nadeem Ahmed.
