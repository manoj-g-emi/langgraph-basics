Heading: Root holds firm Pakistans double stri

Article: strong>BIRMINGHAM: Joe Root led England´s recovery after Pakistan took two early wickets on the fourth day of the third Test at Edgbaston on Saturday.</strongAt lunch, England were 183 for two in their second innings -- a lead of 80 runs -- after losing openers Alastair Cook and Alex Hales.Root dropped on 25 and struggling with a longstanding back problem, was 34 not out, with James Vince 20 not out in an unbroken third-wicket partnership of 57.With the four-match series all square at 1-1, England resumed on 120 without loss, 17 runs in front.Cook, the England captain, was 64 not out and Hales 50 not out after they had erased a first-innings deficit of 103 with their maiden century stand in 18 innings as a Test-match opening pair.But Pakistan removed both batsmen in a dramatic burst of two wickets for no runs in nine balls.Left-hander Cook (66) pushed out to Sohail Khan and a diving Yasir Shah held an excellent catch at point.Sohail had bowled a lacklustre spell Friday after marking his return to Test cricket following a five-year absence with five for 96 in England´s first-innings 297.But, publicly upbraided by Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur after Friday´s stumps, Sohail now whistled a delivery past new batsman Root´s nose.But it was left-arm quick Mohammad Amir who turned England´s 126 for one into 126 for two when Hales (54) edged a seaming delivery and Younis Khan, held a difficult low chance going to his right at second slip.Root, who made a Test-best 254 in England´s 330-run series-levelling win at Old Trafford, countered with two superb boundaries in four balls off Sohail -- a back-foot force followed by a cover-drive.The latter shot has often proved Vince´s undoing in his brief Test career.But it is also one of the Hampshire batsman´s best strokes and it enabled him to get off the mark with a stylish four off Amir.Root, however, had a reprieve on 25 when he edged Rahat Ali only for Mohammad Hafeez to drop the low, two-handed, chance at first slip -- a rare blemish in an otherwise much-improved Pakistan catching effort this match.It was tough luck on left-arm quick Rahat, who reeled off five successive maidens in a probing spell of seven overs costing just seven runs.
