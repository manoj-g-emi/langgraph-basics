Heading: PCBs hunt continues as Law declines head coachs 

Article: ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will have to continue its hunt for the post of head coach as former Australian batsman Stuart Law, who was the top choice of the board for the position, declined to accept the offer.He had applied for a coaching position with us but he has now conveyed he is more interested in a consultants position and that he wouldnt be able to join the team immediately, a foreign news agency quoted the PCB Chairman Shahrayar Khan as saying.Law is already signed up by Cricket Australia as a batting consultant for the tour to Sri Lanka from July to September and apparently he has told the PCB he is also not available when Pakistan tour Australia in November-December this year.Now the board is in talks with former Scotland coach AndyMoles and Australian batsman Dean Jones.The 81- year old Shaharyar added that Law was unavailable to join up with the team immediately as well as not interested in a full-time position.He said PCB were now also talking to Moles and Jones although the BOG had some reservations over some candidates, the PCB chief said.The PCB Chairman also added that Moles would have to leave his current coaching assignments with the associate members he is currently involved with.What is of concern to us is that Moles left or had to leave coaching assignments with Kenya, Scotland, New Zealand and Afghanistan because of disagreements or discord with their boards or players the source said.We want the new coach to join the team before the tour to England from next month. Once the head coach is appointed we will also finalise the rest of the support staff with him, he added.
