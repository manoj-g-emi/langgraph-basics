Article: Hertogenbosch, Netherlands: Nicolas Mahut warmed up for Wimbledon by winning his third ´s-Hertogenbosch title after dominating a rain-delayed final on Monday.After taking the opening set 6-4 against Luxembourg´s Gilles Muller on the Dutch grass court on Sunday, Mahut wrapped up victory by claiming the second set by the same scoreline.It was his third title win in ´s-Hertogenbosch, the 34-year-old eighth-seeded wild card having previously won the Dutch event in 2013 and 2015. It was his fourth career title having also won on grass in Newport in 2013."It was very moving to win my first title here in 2013. Last year, I wasn´t expecting to win. It´s almost too much to win it a third time," said Mahut, who admitted that he had forgotten to sign up for the tournament."I promise not to forget next year!" said the Frenchman who has now won 18 of 20 matches played in ´s-Hertogenbosch.Mahut, currently 61 in the world rankings, faces home favourite and world number two Andy Murray in Queen´s on Tuesday.
