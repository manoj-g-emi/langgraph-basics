Heading: Publish my drug test results says Nad

Article: Rafa Nadal has asked the International Tennis Federation to publish the results of his drug tests following an accusation of doping by a former French cabinet minister.The 14-times grand slam champion said on Monday he was suing Roselyne Bachelot, a former health, sports and social affairs minister, after she alleged the Spaniard had failed a drugs test.The Spaniard wrote to the ITF asking his drug test results to be made public, British media have reported."It can´t be free any more in our tennis world to speak and to accuse without evidence," media reports quoted the 29-year-old as saying."Please make all my information public, please make public my biological passport and my complete history of anti-doping controls and tests.From now on I ask you to communicate when I am tested, and the results, as soon as they are ready from your labs."Nadal has never failed a drug test. The ITF declined Nadal´s request but said the player was free to publish them himself."Mr Nadal  has access to his anti-doping records through WADA´s ADAMS database and is free to make them available," the governing body said in a statement."The accuracy of any such release would be verified by the ITF. "Failed drug tests in elite tennis are rare but doping has been in the spotlight since former women´s world number one Maria Sharapova announced last month she had returned a positive test for banned substance meldonium.
