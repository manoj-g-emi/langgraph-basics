But on Waqars insistence he talked to him on the phone.Khan said that Waqar sounded very upset on the phone as he was complaining of the leakage of his report. He said he had assured him that an enquiry will be conducted in this regard.Waqar, in a strongly worded and revealing report, had criticised the PCB's decision of not giving him a say in the selection process during his tenure and has also lambasted the leadership style of Shahid Afridi, which he felt left the players confused.He also recommended that players like Ahmed Shehzad and Umar Akmal be made to re-earn their place in the national squad with performances in domestic cricket.A six-page report covers an overview of his two-year term as coach and comprises 13 recommendations to help take Pakistan cricket forward.The report, which also touched on selection irregularities based on which Waqar reportedly resigned before the 2015 World Cup, was presented to PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and later to PCB's fact-finding committee.
