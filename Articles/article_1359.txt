Heading: India opt to bowl against Bangladesh in rain reduced Asia Cup fi

Article: DHAKA: India's captain Mahindra Singh Dhoni opted to bowl in the rain-reduced 15-overs a side Asia Cup final in Mirpur. Play was rescheduled to 9:30pm local time, exactly two hours after the scheduled start.Harbhajan Singh, Pawan Negi and Bhuvneshwar Kumar made way for R Ashwin, Ashish Nehra and Ravindra Jadeja in the India XI while Bangladesh brought in left-arm seamer Abu Hider and allrounder Nasir Hossain for their first games of the tournament. They replaced Arafat Sunny and Mohammad Mithun.The pitch was hard with no grass, and is expected to be good for batting, as it had been in the last few matches of the tournament. While the Shere Bangla National Stadium's drainage system did a fine job to take out all the puddles, it was the ground staff who mopped up the outfield quickly.Clouds had started to gather from around 5:30pm before it grew into a storm, locally known as the Kal Boishakhi which is quite usual during spring time in Bangladesh. Rain only relented by 7:40pm. During this period, there were several blackouts, but the 10,000-odd crowd braved the storm before the toss took place at 9:10pm.Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza (captain), Al-Amin Hossain, Abu Hider, Taskin AhmedIndia: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni (capt and wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit Bumrah
