Heading: Australia board slaps bans on three players for betting

Article: MELBOURNE: Australia´s cricket board has banned two players for betting on matches and given a suspended ban to a third as part of its "zero tolerance" approach to gambling-related corruption.Hayley Jensen and Corinne Hall, who play in the national women´s league and women´s domestic Twenty20 tournament, were both given two-year bans with 18 months suspended, Cricket Australia said in a media release on Wednesday.Jensen had admitted placing one bet on the result of the men´s test match between Australia and New Zealand in Brisbane last November.Hall had made two bets relating to two matches in the men´s domestic one-day competition in 2015-16."Jensen and Hall are prohibited from participating in any form of cricket or cricket-related event for a period of six months until 21 October 2016," CA said.Joel Logan, who plays for South Australia in the men´s domestic competition, was sanctioned for placing two bets on the winner of the World T20 tournament.Logan was also given a two-year ban but it was wholly suspended due to "circumstances relating to his match contracts and the specific timing" of his bets.All three players were required to participate in anti-corruption education programs, the board said."We take a proactive, zero-tolerance approach to maintaining the integrity of our sport and this includes any form of betting on cricket globally," CA´s integrity boss Iain Roy said.These players have accepted the seriousness of their errors and have voluntarily accepted their sanctions."CA in February banned 19-year-old women´s cricketer Piepa Cleary for six months, with another 18 months suspended, for placing six bets totalling A$15.50 ($11.50) on a men´s test match between Australia and New Zealand in November.That followed a two-year suspended sentence given to Sydney-based women´s cricketer Angela Reakes in December for placing five bets worth a total of A$9 on the man-of-the-match for last year´s cricket World Cup final.
