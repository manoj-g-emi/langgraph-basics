Heading: shc dismisses caa suspension of air indus operati

Article: KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday dismissed the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) order suspending the operation of Air Indus from July 1. The SHC heard a petition filed by Air Indus whose lawyer informed the court that CAA had imposed the suspension on Air Indus under CAA Policy 2015. He added that the National Aviation Policy has been challenged by Air Indus in SHC and thus no action can be taken under it. The petition states that before taking action no show-cause was issued. The court suspended the CAA order and has issued notices to the federal government and CAA for July 6. On Tuesday, the CAA said unsafe condition and persistent violation of the safety regulations are endangering the safety of Air Indus aircrafts and life of passengers.
