Heading: Sri Lanka lose Perera Australia grab handy lead

Article: strong>PHALLEKELE: Sri Lanka conceded an 86-run first innings lead to Australia and were six for one in their second innings when rain forced an early tea break on the second day of the low-scoring first test at Pallekele on Wednesday.</strongThe hosts, bundled out for 117 in the first innings, lost opener Kusal Perera to fast bowler Mitchell Starc after bowling Australia out for 203.Kaushal Silva was batting on two with Sri Lanka still 80 runs behind in the first match of the three-test series.Earlier, the local spin duo of veteran Rangana Herath (4-49) and debutant Lakshan Sandakan (4-58) shared eight wickets between them to deny Australia a bigger first innings total.Resuming on 66-2, Australia lost both the overnight batsmen to Herath who quit limited-overs cricket in April to focus on the longest format of the game.Australia skipper Steve Smith (30) threw his wicket away in the second over of the day, dancing down the track to try and slog the left-arm spinner only to miss the line and be stumped.Herath returned to dismiss Usman Khawaja (26) in his next over, trapping him leg-before with a turning delivery.Adam Voges (47) survived a vociferous leg-before appeal in the very first delivery he faced from Herath but went on to make the highest score so far in what appears to be a bowler-dominated contest.Mitchell Marsh (31) ran hard between wickets and helped himself to five boundaries before becoming left-arm Chinaman bowler Sandakan's maiden test victim.Paceman Nuwan Pradeep, who had dismissed Australia opener David Warner for a duck on Tuesday, claimed the crucial wicket of Voges.
