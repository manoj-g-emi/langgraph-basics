Heading: Sunrisers clinch maiden IPL title in nail biting 

Article: strong>BENGALURU: The final of the Indian Premier League was indeed a nail-biting contest as Virat Kohli's Challengers fell short of chasing the 209-run target set by Warner's Sunrisers. </strongWhile Gayle and Virat Kohli did add fire to the run-chase earlier on with his 54-run knock as Gayle also chipped in with 76 runs, it fell short of the Sunriser's daunting total of 209. After Virat Kohli was dismissed and Gayle too, no other Challengers' batsman was able to stand tall as even the mighty Shane Watson fell cheaply for 18 runs. Hence, the Royal Challengers Bangalore could not successfully chase the whole target and had to concede the title to the Sunrisers. This was the Sunriser's maiden IPL trophy as the team had lost out on the coveted cup in 2009 and 2011 as well. img alt="" height="255" src="http://apne.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/tiny_mce/source/1.PNG" width="624"/img alt="" height="253" src="http://apne.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/tiny_mce/source/2.PNG" width="625"/
