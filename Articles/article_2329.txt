Heading: Saqlain set for second stint as England spin guru

Article: LONDON: Pakistan off-spin great Saqlain Mushtaq is set for another spell as an England coaching consultant, highlighting how fluid national allegiances can become when a cricketer´s playing days are over.Saqlain was brought in by England ahead of the recent second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford.In the build-up he found himself working with both off-spinner Moeen Ali and leg-break bowler Adil Rashid, although only Ali of the pair made it into the XI that won by 330 runs with more than a day to spare to level the four-match series at 1-1.Saqlain´s former Pakistan team-mate Mushtaq Ahmed, is carrying out a similar role with the tourists in more of a permanent capacity.Prior to taking up his Pakistan role, former leg-spinner Mushtaq was England´s spin-bowling coach.Off-spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan, Test cricket´s all-time leading wicket-taker, has come under fire for working with Australia in their ongoing series in his native Sri Lanka.By contrast the atmosphere between English and Pakistani officials has been far more cordial.That´s partly because, as this is Pakistan´s first tour of England since their infamous 2010 spot-fixing debacle at Lord´s, both sides are desperate to let their cricket do the talking.It is also a reflection of their multi-national backroom staffs, with England head coach Trevor Bayliss an Australian and his Pakistan counterpart, Mickey Arthur, a South African.Added to all that, Pakistan fielding coach Steve Rixon, the former Australia wicket-keeper, and Bayliss -- who made his name internationally as Sri Lanka coach -- were once team-mates in the same New South Wales side.
