Heading: Amir Khan says Muhammad Ali inspired his charity wor

Article: strong>ISLAMABAD: British boxer Amir Khan paid tribute to legendary fighter Muhammad Ali Saturday, calling him the peoples champion and saying Alis life outside the ring had inspired him to help those in need.</strongThe WBC Silver welterweight title holder, currently in Pakistan to open a boxing academy and carry out charity work, said Alis larger-than-life personality had earned him millions of fans around the globe.I was always looking up to him. A great fighter, a guy who wasnt only just a fighter but also a great personality outside the boxing world as well, the 29-year-old said.He would say Im gonna knock him out in the fourth round, and he used to do it in the fourth round. Thats what I used to love about Muhammad Ali.Khan added that Alis fighting style, which combined the speed and agility of a lightweight with the power of a heavyweight, had made him a unique fighter.If you looked at the way he used to fight he was very very different to any other fighter.He was a heavyweight, where he was really, really big, he was heavy. But he moved like a lightweight. So he floated like a butterfly and he did sting like a bee because his shots were fast, powerful and explosive. And he used to hurt his guys, you know, he hurt his opponents.In addition to being widely regarded as the best boxer in history, Ali was outspoken in his fight for social justice, becoming a key figure in the civil rights movement and a leading voice against the US war in Vietnam.He also raised millions of dollars for charity, including his own organisation dedicated to Parkinsons research, a disease he suffered from 1984 onwards.Khan said: I look up to him and I wanna do what he did. Thats why I come places like Pakistan and I spend time here.I kind of picked that out of his book  how Muhammad Ali used to help the less fortunate people. He was more of a peoples champion, not just a champion but a peoples champion and thats how I want to be.Khan has raised some $80,000 for the drought-affected people of Thar district, and pledged to build new wells in the desert region.He will also unveil a new boxing academy in the capital Islamabad aimed at unearthing future fighting champions.
