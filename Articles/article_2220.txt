Heading: Dream comes true as Matthews completes Grand Tour 

Article: REVEL, France: Michael Matthews completed the full set of Grand Tour stage victories with a "dream come true" success at the Tour de France 10th stage on Tuesday.Reigning champion Chris Froome retained the leader´s yellow jersey, the Briton rolling over the line with a languid peloton almost 10 minutes behind Matthews.The 25-year-old Australian had already taken three stage wins at the Vuelta a Espana and two on the Giro d´Italia.But on Tuesday he pipped world champion Peter Sagan and Edvald Boassen Hagen of Norway in a sprint finish following great teamwork from his Orica outfit.Fellow Aussie Luke Durbridge and South African Daryl Impey sacrificed their own victory chances to allow the fast-finishing Matthews to burst to the line first at the end of the 184km trek from Andorra to Revel.Matthews, from Canberra, even had time to lift his arms in celebration before crossing the line."It´s unbelievable. It´s only just sinking in," said Matthews. "I was close to giving in at this race after I had two bad crashes two years and one year ago. I thought maybe this race is not for me but today my dream came true. <br/> "It was never the plan to go for a breakaway today. We wanted a bunch sprint finish but we´re such a strong group of guys.It was a high calibre six-man sprint containing four former Tour stage winners, while Impey once wore the race leader´s yellow jersey.That remained with Froome, with his British countryman Adam Yates, who also rides for Orica, second at 16sec and Dan Martin of Ireland third overall at 19sec.
