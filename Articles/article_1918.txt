Article: strong>PARIS: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for Portugal before becoming the last of the superstars to arrive in France for Friday´s start of the European Championship finals.</strongWith the host nation under a state of emergency over feared terror attacks, strict security has greeted Ronaldo and other headline players as well as the hundreds of thousands of foreign fans gathering for the month-long, 51-match fiesta.France launch the tournament with a Group A game against Romania on Friday at the Stade de France, which was one of the targets of the November 13 attacks last year.And Germany defender Jonas Hector, who was playing for the world champions in Paris on the night of the attacks which killed 130 people, admitted security concerns were a distraction."It´s at the back of your mind, of course, but primarily it comes down to football and enjoyment of the game," said Hector.<br/>"It´s up to the individual whether they come to the stadium or not, anyone who does will clearly really want to be there."Ronaldo scored twice in a 45-minute appearance for Portugal in their 7-0 win over Estonia on Wednesday night, their final match before their first Group F game next Tuesday against Iceland.The three-time World Player of the Year, looking to add a first international trophy to his accolades, banished doubts over his fitness with his two-goal display in Lisbon that allowed Portugal to head for France full of confidence."It has been a long season," he said. "I would have liked to have played more tonight, but I need to hold back and give others playing time."I feel good. There is still a week to go. What I want is a good start to the Euros and an even better finish. It is a difficult competition to win, you have to go step by step."
