Heading: England fight back to leave Test on a knife edg

Article: BIRMINGHAM: England fought back strongly to leave the third Test against Pakistan hanging in the balance after an enthralling third day in Birmingham on Friday.Earlier, Pakistan were bowled out for 400 in reply to England´s first innings 297, a lead of 103 runs. Azhar Ali made 139, his first Test century outside of Asia and recalled left-handed opener Sami Aslam 82. Misbah-ul-Haq´s 56 on Friday was his third fifty of the series, while wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed bolstered Pakistan´s total with an unbeaten 46.Then, Alastair Cook and Alex Hales took England to 120 for no wicket in their second innings at the close, 17 runs ahead with two days remaining at Edgbaston.Cook was 64 not out and Hales 50 not out, with the duo having compiled their first century stand in 18 innings together as a Test match opening pair.Pakistan moved on to 336 for five at lunch and looked set to establish a commanding first-innings lead but England picked up their last five wickets quickly to get a foothold in the match.Cook and Hales batted positively, the former ending on 64 not out and Hales taking a single off the final ball of the day to reach his first fifty of the series which is level at 1-1.After resuming on 257 for three, Pakistan lost the key wicket of Younus Khan in the morning session but captain Misbah-ul-Haq led from the front with a combative 56.Misbah was bowled by James Anderson before England´s leading strike bowler was ordered out of the attack for the rest of the innings after transgressing cricket´s follow-through laws for a third time.Anderson had apologised to the umpires on Thursday for his reaction to receiving his first two warnings for running on the pitch.Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes claimed three wickets each to run through Pakistan´s lower order.
