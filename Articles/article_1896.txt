Heading: Messi could miss potential group decider against Chi

Article: strong>Lionel Messi looks likely to miss Argentinas most important match of the opening phase of the Copa America against title holders Chile at Santa Clara, California on Monday.</strongMessi has not trained with his team since he suffered a back injury in a warm-up friendly nine days ago, a 1-0 win over Honduras in Argentina.The Argentina captain, four times world player of the year, has been working separately and may not even make it onto the field at Levis Stadium, according to reports on Sunday from Argentine media covering the national teams base camp at San Jose.His place will be taken by Nicolas Gaitan, a player who has won 13 caps in six years but who coach Gerardo Martino has identified as his best reserve for Messi without altering tactics.A left-footer who likes playing on the right and cutting inside in attack, with his cub Benficas best assists record in the Portuguese league, his game resembles what Messi does best for his country.I wouldnt risk him, I dont want to lose him in the first match, defender Marcos Rojo was quoted as saying with the team fearing an aggravation of Messis injury could put him out for the rest of the tournament.Chile would be expected to feel some relief at the possible absence of the worlds best player but their captain and goalkeeper, Messis Barcelona team mate Claudio Bravo, said: I want him to play because he adds a lot to the match.On Paper, the other Group D matches against Panama and Bolivia look easy for title favourites Argentina and Chile.Colombia are also fretting on the possible absence of their captain James Rodriguez from their second Group A match against Paraguay at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on Tuesday after he hurt his shoulder during the 2-0 win over hosts the United States at Santa Clara on Friday.
