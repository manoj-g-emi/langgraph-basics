Heading: Heavy rain delays start of Asia Cup fi

Article: DHAKA: A heavy rain with storm here at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur has delayed the toss between Bangladesh and India in the final of the Asia Cup T20 tournament.Streams of water are flowing off the covers protecting the square on to the grass. There is also damage to the big screen at the venue - the frame around the screen itself has been partially blown away by the wind. However, ground staff is making their way out. Work seems to be going on to get the floodlights working again.The match therefore is going to have a delayed start as there is a tremendous amount of water on the outfield. There's going to be quite a delay.As there is no reserve day for the final, the trophy will be shared if the match is not played.
