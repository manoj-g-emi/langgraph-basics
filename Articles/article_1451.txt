Article: strong>ISLAMABAD:  Former cricket stars on Friday pinned hopes on skipper Shahid Afridi to repeat his all-round skills for the second time when Pakistan take on traditional rivals India in the eagerly awaited clash of the World Twenty20 as the sun sets on the lush green Eden Gardens of Kolkata.</strongThe former cricket greats believed the flamboyant all rounder Shahid Afridi could play a key role in national teams win against their arch foes.Afridi, who has been under fire after Pakistan s poor performance in the Asia Cup T20, played superbly both with the bat and ball in national teams win against Bangladesh in their opening match of ongoing T20 World Cup on Wednesday.Batting legend Javed Miandad said he wants Afridi to repeat his heroics of Bangladesh match when time comes for Saturdays encounter.Afridi has to bat up in the order. He must get maximum over s. He can be a terror, Miandad said.The former cricket great also praised Kolkata crowd, stating Kolkata has only sports loving people.They are passionate. Sports should not be a war as the world makes fun of us (when we behave this way) Miandad added.Former superstar Wasim Akram said that Pakistan would psychologically be in a better frame of mind in the match against India.Pakistan are going to the game after a convincing win in their opening match. So psychologically they will have an edge over Indians as they suffered defeat in their first match against  New Zealand, Wasim said.He also asked Pakistan team to adopt an attacking strategy against Indians. If Pakistan manage to get a couple of wickets in the power play session, they will be in a position to push India to the back foot, the former captain said.Former Test Captain Aamir Sohail says bowlers would have to work hard in the high profile World Twenty20 encounter.If India wins the toss and bats first, our bowlers will have to take early wickets in order to restrict the Indian batsmen to a low total.But if our batsmen are put to bat first, then they will have to take the responsibility and show some real performance like they did in the match against Bangladesh, said he.Sohail said: In case India prepares a flat pitch, Pakistan will have an edge over the arch rivals.But if they prepare a turning pitch, then India will have an upper handTest Skipper Misbah ul Haq said Pakistan could  win the WorldTwenty20, if Shahid Afridi performs consistently in the whole tournament.Afridi needs to fire constantly if Pakistan wants to salvage a chance of clinching the title once again.If Afridi keeps going like this, Pakistan can win the World T20, he said.
