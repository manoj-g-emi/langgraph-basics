Heading: Beaumont Winfield whirlwinds flatten Pakistan W

Article: BRISTOL: Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield produced another dazzling opening partnership of 147 - England Women's highest stand in T20s - to set up a 68-run victory in the first T20 at Bristol.Beaumont made 82 off 53 balls and Winfield 74 off 45 to lead England to their highest total in the format. It followed their 235-run opening stand in the second ODI at New Road when they both hit centuries.Beaumont reached her fifty off 30 balls, and having moved to 82 with nearly five overs remaining had time to score England's first T20I century before falling lbw as she attempted a reverse-sweep, meaning Charlotte Edwards' unbeaten 92, against Australia at Hobart, remained Englands best.Like Beaumont, Winfield struck 10 fours and also a six off Sadia Yousuf and her final score equalled her career-best, having also made 74 against South Africa in 2014.At 146 for 0 in 15 overs, 200 was within reach for England but the last five overs were not quite as fluent as the first 15. The 16-20-over block had fewer runs - 41 - than the other five-over breakdowns.The final over included a team hat-trick for Pakistan as Nat Sciver edged a swipe, Danni Wyatt was run out and Heather Knight feathered a reverse-sweep to the keeper.A target of 189 was, unsurprisingly, well out of reach for Pakistan and England's bowling was not stretched in defending the target. Four of the wickets fell to full-tosses, the third of them giving 17-year-old debutant Sophie Ecclestone, a left-arm spinner, her first international wicket when Sidra Ameen picked out deep midwicket.Asmavia Iqbal struck some powerful blows to finish as top-scorer -- including the one six of the innings, which was Pakistan's first of the tour - before being bowled by Danielle Hazell in the final over.
