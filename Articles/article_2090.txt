He can still be the best bowler in the world," he added ahead of Pakistan´s opening three-day tour match against Somerset at Taunton starting Sunday."Whatever form of the game he has played since his comeback, he has done well," said key batman Misbah of Amir, who in his 14 Tests before his ban took 51 wickets at an average of under 30 apiece."He knows he is under pressure but he is handling it well," the Pakistan captain insisted."This is a good chance for him to come here, the place where he had those problems, and show the world he is there to perform and deliver for the team."It is a chance to win back all his fans. It´s a great opportunity and he is working hard."As for Amir receiving a potentially hostile reception from English spectators, Misbah said: "Anything might happen but Amir´s main focus should be on his game."It might happen -- you can always hear voices."The best way is to concentrate on your skills and your duties and Amir has to focus on his game and what he has to do. He is doing well."
