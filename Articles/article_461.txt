Heading: Pakistan begins Kinnow expor

Article: strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has officially kicked off its Kinnow export two months ahead; the government has set an export target of 400,000 tonnes for 2015-16 which is 100,000 tonnes higher than the export target for the previous season.</strongHowever, growers and exporters warn this year that Kinnow production is sub-par and that there is a very likely possibility that the target will be missed by a long shot.Former FPCCI Chairman Standing Committee Ahmad Jawad said the low export quality yield in the ongoing season would keep Pakistan away from the opportunity to fill the gap created by the Russian ban on the import of Turkish oranges after the recent events in the Middle East.He said if government doesnt use preventive measures then Kinnow export will be squeezed further in next two to three years.
