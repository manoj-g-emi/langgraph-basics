Heading: NZ Cricket apologises to Amir for a tau

Article: New Zealand Cricket on Wednesday apologized to Pakistan fast-bowler Mohammad Amir after a stadium announcer played the sound effect of a cash register just before the left-arm pacer was about to start one of his overs.NZC said it was "inappropriate and disrespectful" of the DJ to have played the suggestive sound effect during Friday's third T20 International between Pakistan and New Zealand at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington.According to reports, NZC chief executive David White has reprimanded the DJ and offered a full apology to Amir and the Pakistan team."I think playing the sound effect was inappropriate and disrespectful, and has the effect of trivialising one of the biggest issues facing cricket at the moment," White told a local newspaper."I've contacted the Pakistan team management to apologise, and to assure them there will be no repeat."Amir recently returned to cricket after a five-year ban for spot-fixing and is on his first international tour since his suspension ended.
