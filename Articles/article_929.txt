Heading: Oil prices surge on Saudi ministers talk of possible acti

Article: strong>NEW YORK: Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday after Saudi Arabia´s energy minister said producers may take action to help rebalance global oil markets.</strongThe remarks helped send prices up more than 4 percent in New York, where a barrel of West Texas Intermediate for September delivery closed up $1.78 at $43.49, after having lost more than a dollar the day before.In London, North Sea Brent for October delivery rose $1.99 to $46.04 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange.<br/>Matt Smith of ClipperData said the whipsawing of prices was "crazy."Smith said oil prices had dropped Wednesday after Saudi oil production figures showed the country´s output had risen last month to nearly 11 million barrels per day.But in remarks reported Thursday, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said an informal meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) scheduled for next month would be the occasion for producers to discuss "any possible action."Saudi Arabia´s offer to take action was "completely at odds with this production data," Smith told AFP.<br/>James Williams of WTRG Economics said markets were in an "ongoing battle.""It´s between reality and possibilities, if you will," he told AFP. "The reality is the market continues to be oversupplied, with (a) really big increase in Saudi output last month."
