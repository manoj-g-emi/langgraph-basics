Heading: Russia facing Rio Paralympic b

Article: PARIS: Russia could miss the Paralympics in Rio as well as the Olympics after the International Paralympic Committee decided Friday to open suspension proceedings following a damning report into state-sponsored doping.The IPC said that in light of this week´s McLaren report, it expected to announce a decision on whether or not it will suspend Russia in the week commencing August 1."In light of the prevailing doping culture endemic within Russian sport, at the very highest levels, National Paralympic Committee of Russia (NPC) appears unable or unwilling to ensure compliance with and the enforcement of the IPC´s Anti-Doping Code within its own national jurisdiction," said a statement from the world governing body."The IPC considers this vital to ensuring athletes are able to compete on a level playing field."The suspension of NPC Russia will now be considered in accordance with the IPC Suspension Policy. That process will include, amongst other things, appropriate dialogue with NPC Russia in order to afford them due process and to allow them to present their case."The IPC said they have been provided with the names of the Paralympic athletes associated with the 35 "disappearing positive samples" from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory which were highlighted in McLaren´s report.They are also sending 19 samples from the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi for immediate further analysis, after they were identified as having been potentially doctored as part of a sample-swapping regime.Should Russia be suspended they will have 21 days to appeal the decision.<br/> The Paralympics take place in Rio from September 7 to 18."The McLaren report revealed an unimaginable scale of institutionalised doping in Russian sport that was orchestrated at the highest level. McLaren´s findings are of serious concern for everyone committed to clean and honest sport," said Philip Craven, the IPC president."With regard to NPC Russia, we have started proceedings to consider the suspension of their membership of the IPC."This decision was not taken lightly, but after fully evaluating the report and the additional information we have received, the IPC believes that the current environment in Russian sport -- which stems from the highest levels -- is such that NPC Russia appears unable to fulfil its IPC membership obligations in full."
