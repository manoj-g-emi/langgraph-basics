Heading: McCullum says Amir should get benefit of doub

Article: WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited-overs matches in New Zealand this month.Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one-day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa.The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program, McCullum said.If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster, added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended), White said.He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing, added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week.
