Heading: Sri Lanka hit back after Bairstow steers England to 416

Article: LONDON: Jonny Bairstow continued a brilliant year of run-scoring with a Test-best 167 not out against Sri Lanka at Lord´s on Friday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 162 for one in reply to England´s first innings 416, a deficit of 254 runs.Kaushal Silva was 79 not out and Kusal Mendis unbeaten on 25 after left-handed opener Karunaratne made exactly 50.Considering the start of this series saw Sri Lanka become the first side since 1958 to be dismissed for under 120 in three successive Test innings, this was a fine effort.There had been signs of recovery in their last innings, where Sri Lanka made 475 in a nine-wicket defeat in the second Test, giving England an unassailable 2-0 lead in this three-match series.Karunaratne should have been out for 28 on Friday when he nicked all-rounder Chris Woakes, only for Bairstow to drop the two-handed waist-high chance.Karunaratne cashed in and after tea struck James Anderson, the world´s number one ranked Test bowler, for three fours in as many balls, including a well-hit drive.Yet having completed a 95-ball fifty, Karunaratne was dismissed when a leg glance was well caught by a diving Bairstow to give under-pressure fast bowler Steven Finn a wicket on his Middlesex home ground.Karunaratne´s exit ended an opening stand of 108 with Silva -- easily Sri Lanka´s best top-order partnership of the series.Silva took Sri Lanka to 150 with a sublime drive through extra-cover for four off Stuart Broad.It wasn´t until January that the 26-year-old Bairstow scored his first Test century.<br/> But since January 1 he has been in prolific batting form for both county champions Yorkshire and England, scoring 594 runs at an average of 118.8 in Tests and 1,127 runs in first-class cricket at 102.4.Friday saw Bairstow receive good support from Woakes (66) in a seventh-wicket partnership of 144.Meanwhile, Sri Lanka left-arm spinner Rangana Herath took an economical four for 81 in 36 overs.England resumed on 279 for six with Bairstow 107 not out and Woakes unbeaten on 23.Bairstow´s second century of the series, following his 140 on his Headingley home ground in the first Test, helped rescue England from the depths of 84 for four.Woakes was the initial aggressor on Friday and a boundary off Eranga saw him to a maiden Test fifty in 102 balls. But Woakes fell when caught and bowled by Herath off a chipped drive.Bairstow batted on and his leg-glanced four off Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews saw him surpass his previous Test-best 150 not out against South Africa at Cape Town in January.
