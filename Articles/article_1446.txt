Heading: Bullish Steyn ready to lead S Africa World Twenty20 bid

Article: strong>South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has sounded a warning to batsmen at the World Twenty20 in India as he prepares to get his sides campaign off to a positive start against England in Mumbai on Friday.</strongSteyn recently returned to the South Africa side after an injury-plagued season that he says has only increase his resolve to help his side to an elusive major one-day trophy.Following a 2-0 home Twenty20 series victory over England last month, the South Africans are brimming with confidence.I dont want to say that we have the upper hand but we have beaten them (England) in the shorter format and they do know it. Im fit and strong to play, Steyn told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday.Steyn, who returned to action this month against Australia after groin and shoulder problems, has seen an improvement in South Africas limited-overs bowling attack which also includes seamers Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott and Chris Morris.When I walked into the side for the Australia series I could see the guys were glowing with confidence, Steyn said.I was watching guys who normally sit on the side lines like Kyle Abbott landing their yorkers and slower balls.It was great to be out of the side because when I walked back in I realised how much I had missed it and how much these guys have grown as a team, even in that two month gap.South Africa play their opening two World Twenty20 matches against England and Afghanistan in the seam-friendly conditions of the Wankhede Stadium in MumbaiThey then take on West Indies at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur, which produced a rank turner in the game between India and New Zealand on Tuesday.Ive always said that I can bowl on any track, Steyn said.I prefer the wickets that are slower and turning. The ball stops and makes it tough for batsmen to hit you out of the ground, especially at a ground like Nagpur which is a big ground.As a seamer I back myself. I can bowl fast cutters, its difficult to hit the ball out of the ground when its coming at 140 or 145 and is gripping and stopping.
