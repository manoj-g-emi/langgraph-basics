Article: East London: Fifties from Hayley Matthews and Britney Cooper, followed by a five-wicket haul from fast bowler Deandra Dottin set up West Indies Women's 16-run win against South Africa Women in East London.West Indies, opting to bat, lost their opener Shaquana Quintyne early, but a 56-run stand for the third wicket between Matthews and Dottin lifted the team past 100. Matthews top-scored with 56, but both she and Dottin were trapped lbw by Sune Luus in quick succession, pegging the visitors back. Cooper, though, provided West Indies with much-needed impetus, stroking an unbeaten 55 off 66 balls, with six fours and a six. Cooper added 48 runs in the company of Shemaine Campbelle, as West Indies ended with 214 for 7.South Africa's opener Trisha Chetty made a steady start to the chase, scoring 47, but her dismissal in the 23rd over led to a slide, as quick blows from Dottin and Anisa Mohammed reduced the hosts to 120 for 7. Marizanne Kapp (69*) and Shabnim Ismail (34) put up a brief resistance, combining for a 70-run partnership, but Dottin and Quintyne eventually ran through the tail to bundle South Africa out for 198.Dottin was the pick of the bowlers with 5 for 34, her maiden five-wicket haul, while Quintyne and Anisa chipped in with two scalps apiece.
