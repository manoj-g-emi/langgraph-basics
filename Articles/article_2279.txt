Heading: Cook vows to use Pakistans enthusiastic celebration as motivati

Article: strong>England Test team captain Alastair Cook has promised to use Pakistan's 'army style' celebration after their victory at Lord's and come back strong in the second Test match. </strong"Its never nice to lose at Lords and see the opposition like they were at the end, he said. Well use that as motivation," he added. The English captain was also not generous when it came to acknowledging the bowling prowess of Pakistani leg-spinner Yasir Shah and instead, referred to his batsmen as 'naive' for throwing away their wickets. "We had a few poor shot selections to certain types of balls. We played some naïve shots at times to certain angles. You could see what Pakistan were tying to do and we fell into the trap. Were striving to become the best side we can be, but naïve is the word. To allow Yasir to get six wickets when the ball wasnt turning was frustrating," he said. However, Cook was hopeful of his team bouncing back in the remaining three Test matches of the series. "Its disappointing, but the beauty of a four-Test series is there are three more chances to put it right. Weve been beaten before and come back strong," he said. After Pakistan beat England at the first Test match at Lord's, the whole team dropped down and performed five press ups as an acknowledgement to the army trainers who had helped them get fit for the English tour. English cricketer Tim Bresnan also warned the Pakistani team of being overconfident in a tweet message.  dir="ltr" lang="en"> Pakistan and England clash again on Friday at Old Trafford.
