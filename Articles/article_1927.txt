Heading: Muhammad Ali funeral procession begi

Article: strong>Louisville: A mass funeral procession for Muhammad Ali began Friday in his hometown Louisville, with a hearse carrying the boxing legend´s remains heading into the streets where thousands gathered to say goodbye.</strongSpectators carried signs and flowers, and some even chanted the name of the three-time heavyweight world champion, who died last week at the age of 74 after a long battle with Parkinson´s disease.The procession started at about 10:30 am (1430 GMT), roughly an hour behind schedule.The cortege will pass by sites that were important to "The Greatest": his childhood home, the Ali Center, the Center for African American Heritage -- which focuses on the lives of blacks in Kentucky -- and, of course, along Muhammad Ali Boulevard before arriving at the Cave Hill Cemetery for a hero´s burial.Many of those lining the 18-mile (30-kilometer) route took photos of the hearse and limousines carrying Ali´s relatives and close friends.Toya Johnson wore an "Ali" T-shirt and was waiting close to her hero´s boyhood home to see him one last time."He would have loved people to gather like this, so we do it. I came at 7:00 am to be sure to get a spot for my chair in the shade," Johnson told AFP."The kids love him, he´s always stood for hope in this neighborhood. For the youth here, he is an example, and this (example) is not over!"
