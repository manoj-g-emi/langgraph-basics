Heading: Azhar says Pakistans fast bowling attack best in the world

Article: strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistans new bowling coach Azhar Mahmood believes Pakistan teams fast bowling attack is the best in the world at present, saying the pace trio of Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Irfan and Wahab Riaz is outstanding.</strongAzhar who has replaced bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed (who has been rested for Asia Cup and World Twenty20 due to fatigue) said that Amir, Irfan and Wahab are among the best fast bowling attacks in the world at present.We have one of the best bowling sides in the world and Amir is a proven match-winner and then you add a seven footer Irfan who has an advantage of height, the pace battery of the side looks really exciting. Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things. I would be more than happy to help them get better in their skill not just from the bowling perspective but batting and fielding as well, Azhar added.
