Heading: India declare with 304 run lead over West Indi

Article: strong>India built a first-innings lead of 304 runs before declaring at 500 for nine on day three of the second test against West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica on Monday.</strongAjinkya Rahane scored his seventh test century, and the third in four innings, compiling an unbeaten 108 off 237 balls.He made 127 and 100 not out against South Africa in Delhi in December. Rahane brought up his century with a somewhat lucky boundary when he edged off-spinner Roston Chase between the wicketkeeper and first slip.Light rain prompted a brief stoppage during the second session and more showers are forecast for Tuesday at Sabina Park, which might offer West Indies a lifeline as they try to avoid losing the first two tests in the four-match series.But with seven sessions still to play, they face a tall order to save the game. The West Indies bowlers stuck to their task well, keeping the India batsmen subdued for long periods.It took the visitors 171 overs to compile their mammoth total as they scored at less than three runs per over.Chase (5-121) returned the best figures while captain Jason Holder got little reward for his efforts, conceding only 72 runs from 34.2 lively overs.He picked up only one wicket, his first of the series, when he trapped Wriddhiman Saha lbw for 47.
