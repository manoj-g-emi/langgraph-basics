The model guns - automatic pistols and rifles - would very clearly be imitations and would pose no security problems, he added."Kalashnikov is one of the most popular brands that come to mind for most people in the world when they hear about Russia," Kalashnikov's head of marketing, Vladimir Dmitriev, said in a press release."So, we are pleased to provide the opportunity for everyone to take away from Russia a souvenir with our company brand."The AK-47, the first rifle the firm produced, has acquired an iconic status due to its low production costs and reliability in extreme conditions. It was introduced in 1948, armed the whole of the Soviet Union and eastern Europe in communist times and served largely pro-Soviet rebel forces across Africa and Asia.Produced also under licence beyond Russian frontiers, it remains one of the most popular assault rifles in the world.Sheremetyevo International Airport is Moscow's and Russia's largest airport by passenger traffic. In 2015, it handled more than 31 million passengers.
