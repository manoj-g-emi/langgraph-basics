Heading: Fresh milk prices increased by Rs5 per litr

Article: strong>Karachi: The inefficiency of the city administration has exposed again as a group of fresh milk sellers has illegally raised the rates of fresh milk by Rs5per liter, selling it at Rs85per litre in some localities.</strongMajority of citizens are compelled to buy this fresh milk because the rate of tetra packed fresh milk is very high which needs urgent rationalization.In fact the sellers of tetra packed, fresh milk have made a monopoly due to weak and non-working anti-monopoly laws in Karachi and sheer disregard to consumer rights in city administration circles.The consumers demand a steep cut in the price of tetra packed fresh milk and equalizing it with the unpacked fresh milk being sold at local milk shops.This long awaited step would not only provide some relief to consumers frustrate the bullying of dairy farmers and retail milk sellers but also increase the profit of the sellers of tetra packed milk in shape of increased sales.The government needs to break the hegemony of tetra packed milk sellers and rationalize the prices of their commodities in the larger public interest.
