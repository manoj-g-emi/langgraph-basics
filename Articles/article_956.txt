Heading: KNs wins five gold medals at IFFA in Germany

Article: KARACHI: Reflecting upon Pakistans history, we come across some national accomplishments that not only etch out the existence of Pakistan on the global front but also give us a reason to stand tall alongside other countries of the world. Be it the 1992 cricket World Cup, when Pakistani Cornered Tigers outclassed England on the Melbourne Cricket Ground, or that moment of sheer pride, as the likes of Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo dribbled around Made in Pakistan footballs at one of the most watched sporting events - The FIFA World Cup.The Pakistani people were again beaming with joy when Ali Moin Nawazish set a world record by attaining 21 As in the A levels, Cambridge International Examination, adding to the vast gallery of national accolades. Keeping with this tradition of bringing back laurels and honouring the Nation, Pakistani chicken and frozen food company, K&amp;Ns, provided us with yet another opportunity to celebrate, by winning medals at IFFA International Quality Competition, in Frankfurt, Germany.The IFFA International Quality Competition for sausages and cold cuts takes place during IFFA trade fair in Frankfurt, Germany, which is the worlds leading trade fair for the global meat industry. This IFFA competition is organised every 3 years and brands from around the world submit their products for valuation. Judging is conducted by independent and trained expert judges on the following criteria:-External product finishing, and condition of the package/containe-Product appearance, colour and composition-Product consistency/texture-Product aroma and tasteK&amp;Ns not only won 5 gold medals, 1 silver and 1 bronze for all 7 products that were entered into the competition against entries from European Union countries, North America, South American and Asian countries, but also walked away with a special trophy for winning 5 gold medals.The true extent of this achievement is grasped when one realizes K&amp;Ns was honoured by the masters of sausage making themselves  the Germans. When we witness that K&amp;Ns stays true to its commitment to food safety, by bringing us world-class chicken products, for which it has received international recognition, the sense of reassurance the brand extends to provide world-class frozen chicken products is further strengthened.
