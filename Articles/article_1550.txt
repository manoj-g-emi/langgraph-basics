Heading: India replace injured Yuvraj with batsman Pandey

Article: MUMBAI: World Twenty20 hosts India have replaced injured all-rounder Yuvraj Singh with middle-order batsman Manish Pandey, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Wednesday.Yuvraj, who played a crucial role in India´s victory in the inaugural edition of the tournament in 2007, twisted his ankle while batting during Sunday´s six-wicket victory over Australia that secured India´s place in the last four of the tournament.Pandey, 26, will fancy his chances of playing when India take on 2012 champions West Indies in the second semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday, even though Ajinkya Rahane will also stake his claim for a place in the starting side.Pandey, who is the first batsman from his country to smash a century in the Indian Premier League (IPL) Twenty20 competition, has played only four one-day internationals and a couple of T20 internationals.
