Heading: Australia win toss bat against Indi

Article: MOHALI: Steven Smith won the toss and chose to bat in Australia's quasi quarter-final against India in the Super Ten Group Two match of the World Twenty20 here at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium on Sunday night.Both captains named unchanged teams, Australia resisting the temptation to tweak their side after beating Pakistan, and India now going through the group stage with the same XI in each match.Smith said the pitch looked good for batting but might slow up later in the game, and MS Dhoni said he too would have batted had he won the toss. "It looks like a surface that the batsmen will love," Dhoni said. "But it depends, how well it comes off the wicket."Both teams had beaten Bangladesh and Pakistan, and lost to New Zealand, which made the clash a straight knockout contest. The winner will progress to the semi-final along with New Zealand.India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni (captain &amp; wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Ashish NehraAustralia: Usman Khawaja, Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith (captain),  Glenn Maxwell, Shane Watson, James Faulkner, Peter Nevill (wk), Adam Zampa, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Josh Hazlewood.
