Heading: Maturing Kyrgios knocks Wawrinka out of Madrid O

Article: LONDON: Australian Nick Kyrgios let his tennis do the talking against Stanislas Wawrinka as he knocked the fourth seed out of the Madrid Open with a scintillating display on Wednesday.Last year the 20-year-old got a suspended 28-day ban and $25,000 fine after making lurid remarks about Swiss Wawrinka´s girlfriend during their match at the Rogers Cup in Montreal.Kyrgios, who has had several brushes with authority, was widely criticised, but his 7-6(7) 7-6(2) second round victory on Wednesday was further proof of a growing maturity after he won his first ATP title earlier this year in Marseille.There was the odd outburst at the umpire, one after a first serve during the first-set tiebreak was called out despite appearing to clip the line, but Kyrgios kept his emotions in check to edge a tight tussle.Japan´s Kei Nishikori, the sixth seed, had a narrow escape before joining Kyrgios in the third round.Italy´s Fabio Fognini recovered from losing the opening set to level the match and served for the match at 5-4 in the decider before imploding.Nishikori won 6-2 3-6 7-5 to set up a meeting with Frenchman Richard Gasquet.
