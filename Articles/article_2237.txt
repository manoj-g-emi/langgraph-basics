Article: strong>LOS ANGELES: Filipino boxing star Manny Pacquiao plans to come out of retirement to fight an as yet to be named opponent later this year, ESPN reported Tuesday.</strongPacquiao´s promoter Bob Arum told ESPN that the former welterweight champion plans to fight on either October 29 or November 5 as a main event bout in Las Vegas as long as it doesn´t clash with his senate duties in the Philippines."Manny wants to come back," Arum said. "The problem is he can only come back if it doesn´t interfere with his senate duties."We had penciled him in for October 15 at Mandalay Bay, but we were informed that is no longer possible because he has to spend that week leading up to October 15 formulating the budget in the senate and doing the votes... so we are looking at October 29 or November 5."
