Heading: US stocks surge as voters head to 

Article: strong>NEW YORK: US stock markets reversed an early fall Tuesday and surged sharply higher as voters headed to polls to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for their next president.</strongAdding to Monday´s 2 percent gains, which came as Democrat Clinton´s chances for a victory appeared to improve, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.7 percent in early afternoon trade.What caused the sharp mid-morning reversal was unclear; the markets swung almost one percentage point in a short period and the closely-watched Vix volatility index, a signal of market nervousness, fell sharply at the same time.The move came at about the same time a new polling group, Votecastr, released an analysis of early voting in key swing state Florida that showed Clinton ahead of Trump.Votecastr´s analyses are not based on actual voting but extrapolations of observed turnout in Tuesday´s voting compared with actual turnout and vote data from previous elections.But Michael James of Wedbush Securities said there was no single catalyst for the surge higher; it was a continuation of Monday´s momentum."Yesterday was probably the best single day we´ve had in six months. Buyers were poised to buy at any pull-back and that is exactly what happened."Markets have shown a clear preference for Clinton, given Trump´s promises to shake up US economic policy and his controversial foreign policy statements. Clinton´s prospects for a win gained after the weekend statement by FBI director James Comey that cleared Clinton of wrongdoing over a long investigation into her private email server.At 1 pm (1800 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 18,393.62, up 0.7 percent.The broad-based S&amp;P 500 added 0.7 percent to 2,146.46, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.9 percent to 5,213.59.
