Heading: Chetty van Niekerk fifties set up SA wi

Article: EAST LONDON: Trisha Chetty and Dane van Niekerk both stroked half-centuries, paving the way for South Africa Women's 35-run win against West Indies Women in East London. Victory was not of much significance, though, as West Indies had already sealed the three-match series having won the first two ODIs.South Africa, opting to bat, compiled a score of 235 for 6, built on the back of two big partnerships. First, Chetty (55) and Mignon du Preez (43) added 72 for the second wicket, before Marizanne Kapp (39) and van Niekerk provided the innings late impetus by stringing together a 64-run fifth-wicket stand. Van Niekerk slammed 55 off 48 balls before being run out.West Indies, in reply, lost their opener Hayley Matthews early in the chase, but Shaquana Quintyne and Kyshona Knight led a recovery with a 57-run partnership for the second wicket. However, just when they seemed steady, the visitors lost wickets in a cluster to soon fall to 118 for 5. Merissa Aguilleira and Shemaine Campbelle offered the team some hope by adding 52 for the sixth wicket, but Aguilleira's wicket in the 43rd over left the lower order with too much to do, as West Indies could only muster 200 for 8 from their 50 overs.Masabata Klaas and Sune Luus snared two wickets apiece, while Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka and van Niekerk chipped in with one each.
