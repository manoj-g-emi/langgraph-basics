Article: strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan team manager Intikhab Alam feels pacer Mohammad Amir is all set to play the first Test match against England at Lords on July 14, saying he is fully prepared for the tour.</strongAmirs expected return to Test cricket at a ground where he last played in 2010 is a topic that seems to have generated a lot of hype.Understandably the Pakistan team management is well aware of the hype surrounding the occasion, Intikhab said.The only concern in Pakistan minds is Amirs cricket related preparations for the game at Lords. Amir is all set to play the first Test match at Lords.We all know about the circumstances surrounding his return but he is mentally prepared for this tour and he will be able to handle himself well, he told Pakpassion.net.He said this is not the first time Amir is touring a foreign country after returning to international cricket and he also has been to England before.The Pakistan fast bowling attack apart from Amir and Wahab Riaz is inexperienced but Intikhab said it could provide a few shocks to the opposition.There is no doubt that our pace attack lacks the kind of experience that has been the hallmark of previous visiting Pakistan sides but I would caution against under estimating their capabilities.They have all been bowling well in recent times and are physically fit and will provide a sterntest for the England batsmen, he said.Speaking about the new head coach he said we are very fortunate to have someone of the stature of Mickey Arthur as Head Coach for Pakistan.He is working very hard with the team and the players are responding nicely and enthusiastically to his advice and comments.We will prepare well and put in the effort needed and God willing when the time comes make the nation proud of this team, he said.
