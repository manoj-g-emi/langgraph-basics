Heading: New Zealand reach 145 8 despite Mustafizurs five wkt hau

Article: KOLKATA: New Zealand set a moderate target of 146 runs for Bangladesh in the Super Ten Group Two match of the World Twenty20 here on Saturday.Batting first after their captain Kane Williamson won the toss, New Zealand found it difficult to make runs on a slow pitch of the Eden Gardens.  However, they managed to score 145 for eight despite a remarkable bowling performance by left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman, who captured five wickets for just 22 runs in his four overs.These were his best bowling figures in T20 Internationals and also the best for any bowler in this World T20. This is the second best bowling performance by any Bangladeshi bowler after Ilyas Sunnys five for 13.The main scorers for New Zealand were Williamson (42), Colin Munro (35) and Ross Taylor (28).New Zealand, already through to the semi-finals with three wins in as many matches, made two changes to their side from their last game against Pakistan.They included an extra spinner in Nathan McCullum for paceman Adam Milne while Henry Nicholls came in for the in-form Martin Guptill, who was rested.Bangladesh, bottom of Group Two and seeking their first win in the group stages, made no changes to the team that lost to India by one run in a thriller in Bangalore on Wednesday.
