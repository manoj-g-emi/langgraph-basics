Heading: ICC chief backs Amir to tour England

Article: strong>London: International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson expects Pakistan quick bowler Mohammad Amir to tour England next month, saying his return is a "good thing" for the sport.</strongAmir, 24, featured in two one-day internationals against New Zealand in January and the Pakistan Cricket Board have approached their English counterparts for help in securing a visa for the talented left-armer.He was given a six-month prison sentence, of which he served half in a UK young offenders´ institute, on charges of conspiracy to accept corrupt payments and conspiracy to cheat at gambling after bowling deliberate no-balls during the Lord´s Test in August 2010.The same spot-fixing scandal also saw fellow paceman Mohammad Asif and then Pakistan Test captain Salman Butt given jail sentences by an English court and bans by the ICC.Although now cleared to play again by the ICC, Amir´s criminal conviction could see him denied an entry visa to Britain for Pakistan´s tour of England, where they will play four Tests -- the first at Lord´s -- five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 between July and September."I always think you get handed out your punishment, you serve it and then who are we to say ´never again?´," Richardson told AFP in an interview at The Oval in south London on Wednesday following the launch of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy one-day tournament."He (Amir) has certainly shown a willingness to make sure he sets an example now by asking younger players to learn from his mistakes."Certainly, I think it´s a good thing that he´s back playing," the 56-year-old added."I´d be surprised if he (Amir) doesn´t end up coming (to England)."
