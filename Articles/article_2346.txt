Heading: Latham Williamson help Kiwis build lead

Article: BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe: Unbeaten half-centuries from Tom Latham and Kane Williamson saw New Zealand move effortlessly into a first-innings lead on day two of the first Test against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club on Friday.Latham moved to within two runs of a fourth Test century, while Williamson was unbeaten on 61 as New Zealand reached tea on 214 for one in reply to Zimbabwe´s 164 all out.The Black Caps started the day on 32 without loss, but saw Martin Guptill depart for 40 during the morning session when he reached for a delivery from Chamu Chibhabha and edged low to gully.Latham and Williamson spent a short period before the lunch interval consolidating, but then increased the scoring rate after the break, adding 112 runs in the second session.Legspinner Graeme Cremer was the only bowler to trouble the pair in their unbroken stand of 135, as he found turn and bounce to occasionally beat the edge of the bat.Left-arm paceman Neil Wagner was the standout performer on day one, when his career-best figures of 6 for 41 helped to bowl Zimbabwe out cheaply on a placid surface.
