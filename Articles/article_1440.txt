Heading: Pakistan hammer 201 5 against Bangladesh in Super 10

Article: KOLKATA:  Pakistan batsmen dominated the Bangladesh bowlers to pile up a huge total of 201 runs for five in their 20 overs against Bangladesh when they began their World Twenty20 campaign in the Group Two Super 10 stage at the crowded Eden Gardens on Wednesday.Mohammad Hafeez and Ahmed Shehzad struck half centuries and skipper Shahid Afridi came up with a breezy cameo to guide their team to set a difficult target for the Tigers.Opting to bat first, Pakistan lost opener Sharjeel Khan (18) cheaply but Hafeez (64) and Shehzad (52) added 95 runs to lay the foundation for a 200-plus total.Shahid Afridi promoted himself up the batting order to number four and smashed  four sixes and as many fours in his 19-ball 49 before falling in the final over.Bangladesh´s left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny, who was reported for a suspect bowling action earlier in the tournament, claimed 2-34 but it was otherwise a forgettable outing for their bowling attack.This was for the second time that Pakistan crossed 200-run mark in a T20 International. Earlier, they had scored 203 for five, also against Bangladesh at Karachi in 2008.
