Heading: Sania Mirza receives Indias Padma Bhushan award

Article: NEW DELHI: Indias ace tennis player Sania Mirza received the Padma Bhushan, Indias third highest civilian honour from President Pranab Mukherjee at a glittering function at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on Tuesday.On Monday, Sania was also honoured at the NRI of the Year Award 2016.It has been a good year for Sania as the 29-year-old forged a formidable partnership with Swiss sensation Martina Hingis last year and some incredible performances saw the pair bag one laurel after another.Mirza and Hingis however saw their incredible winning run come to a halt earlier this year as they bagged their first defeat in 42 matches at the WTA Qatar Open.Following that, the pair fondly named "SanTina " suffered back-to-back second round exits in the Miami Open as well as the Indian Wells. However, the performance shown by the duo last year gave immense reasons for the Government of India to consider Mirza for the country's third-highest civilian award.Mirza and Hingis won the Wimbledon 2015 women's doubles title, the US Open 2015 women's doubles title as well as the Australian Open 2016 women's double title to solidify their numero uno position at the WTA doubles rankings.Sania, meanwhile, is also a recipient of the Arjuna Award, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, as well as the Padma Shri.
