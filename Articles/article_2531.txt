This marked the opening of the new route between both the countries, who are ambitiously seeking trade partnerships with each other which could benefit them immensely. These goods are then transported to all parts of the world from the Karachi port. According to Chinese experts, the new route will prove cost-effective in the sense that it would reduce transportation costs by as much as fifty-percent compared with past services. Experts also stated that it would be beneficial for the local firms and traders, who could not expand more and cater to the demands of international clients.
