He remained the 'King of Swing' throughout his 19 year long career.In his cricketing career that spanned over almost two decades Wasim has taken a whooping 916 international wickets and to date continues to be an inspiration to aspiring cricketers.Wasim, considered to be the most prolific Pakistani fast bowler to have ever played the game, picked up an impressive 414 wickets in 104 test matches while in ODIs, he has notched up 502 wickets in the 356 matches that he played for Pakistan. At blistering pace, Wasim Akram's reverse swing deliveries bamboozled batsmen around the world and made him one of the most respected cricketers of all time. He also has the honour of being part of the 1992 World Cup-winning Pakistan cricket team, led by Imran Khan. Akram's three wickets in the final helped Pakistan clinch the match and the world cup. Wasim Akram captained Pakistan briefly after Imran Khan and Javed Miandad retired and led his side to the world cup final in 1999 but since then, match-fixing allegations and complications got in the way of his captaining the side ever again. He retired after the 2003 World Cup, when he was dropped from the national squad after Pakistan's dismal performance. Wasim has also been appointed as the bowling coach of the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders and frequently commentates as well. Wasim married Australian Shaniera Thompson in 2013 and has a daughter from her named Aiyla. He will always be included among not only the greatest cricketers to have emerged from Pakistan, but the world over.
