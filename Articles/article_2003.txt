Heading: Ramazan time Euro 2016 fever sweeps Arab world

Article: KUWAIT CITY: From Dubai to Tunis, Euro 2016 football fever is sweeping the Arab world, filling cafes and restaurants and overshadowing the nightly television soap operas that normally dominate Ramazan viewing.Every year, during the Muslim fasting month, television audiences soar as families gather in front of their sets after breaking the daytime fast.Usually the ratings are dominated by the dozens of rival soaps that are aired by state and private channels. But this year, Ramazan coincides with the Euros which are another massive draw.Cafes in the Egyptian capital have draped the flags of competing countries over their entrances to attract fans. Some games are played during the day, when devout Muslims are fasting, while others clash with the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast at sunset.In Tunisia, where most cafes are closed during daylight hours in Ramazan, the venue moves to people´s homes. Evening games begin a few minutes after Muslims break their fast, a time most Tunisians spend with their families watching television.Television viewing in the region peaks during Ramazan with ratings remaining high well into the night and advertisers devote large chunks of their budget to the small screen´s high season.With most games showing on foreign satellite channels, the main Tunisian channels have scheduled daily analysis programmes on the matches.Ramazan hasn´t stopped people following the contest on big screens in the Gulf.In Kuwait, whose national team was banned by FIFA in October from taking part in World Cup qualifying matches because of alleged government interference in sports, fans take consolation in the Euros.Germany, the reigning world champions, are the most supported team in Kuwait and in many other Arab countries, exceeding defending European champions.In Dubai, one restaurant has erected a huge tent on the beach with big screens to show the games.
