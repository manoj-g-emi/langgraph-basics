Heading: Raonic takes revenge on Federer to win Brisbane ti

Article: BRISBANE: An inspired Milos Raonic toppled Roger Federer 6-4 6-4 to win the Brisbane International on Sunday and avenge his defeat to the Swiss master in last year´s final.Raonic unleashed his usual serving blitz but it was the rangy Canadian´s groundstrokes that impressed the most as he outwitted the Swiss with a masterful display of clean hitting from the baseline.Federer, irrepressible in his semi-final win over Dominic Thiem, was off-colour from the start at Pat Rafter Arena and his 25-year-old opponent feasted repeatedly on his wayward backhand.Beaten in three tight sets last year, Raonic won at a canter in the rematch to clinch his eighth tour title and complete the perfect buildup to his bid for a maiden grand slam at the Australian Open starting later this month.Closing out the match with a booming first serve that Federer could only parry long, Raonic roared in triumph, having beaten the 17-times grand slam champion for only the second time in 11 encounters.He accepted the winner´s trophy from 77-year-old Australian great Rod Laver, the only player to complete the calendar grand slam twice.Long tipped to rock the tennis establishment, Raonic showed a bullet-proof poise in response to his opponent´s frustration and broke Federer´s serve in the ninth game of the opening set.Federer blasted a forehand long to concede the set then blew a gilt-edged chance to break Raonic early in the second by spraying a backhand long.Missing a regulation forehand winner down the line, Federer gave up a break-point and Raonic captured the decisive break in the eighth game.Federer battled hard to put the set back on level terms, but Raonic´s thunderbolt serve proved to be impenetrable.(Reuters)
