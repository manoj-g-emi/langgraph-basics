Article: strong>ISLAMABAD: Former Australian fast bowler and ex Pakistan head coach Geoff Lawson believes Salman Butt can make a comeback for Pakistan saying he is highly motivated and is an outstanding talent.</strongLawson said Butt is still young and can make a comeback for Pakistan. When I was his coach he was an outstanding talent.That talent doesnt go away but it depends on how much you are motivated and how much you still want to do well.It wouldnt surprise me if Butt made a successful international comeback, Pakpassion.net quoted him as saying.Speaking about Muhammad Amir Lawson said he remembers Amir asa very young player who came to some of my practice sessions when I was coaching Pakistan.Amir was working with the Under 19s and even then looked very impressive.I am pleased that after a difficult period he has comeback bigger and stronger and is bowling terrifically well. It is also very good for Pakistan cricket that he is back he said.Talking about the attitude of some Pakistani players that has come into question after comments from some coaches Lawson said if people are not willing to work hard then there are enough good young players in Pakistan to replace them.Get people in who are motivated. If you arent playing for your country then there is no point in playing cricket.Pakistan has had some pretty successful times lately under Waqar Younis and Misbah ul Haq and one would hope that the players would continue to be motivated, he said.Commenting on the Day Night Test cricket he said he is surprised at the resistance of some countries.Well done to Pakistan in agreeing to play a Day Night Test match in Australia.The pink ball is not that different to a red ball in any case you just have to practice with it and its fine.We use red or white so why not use pink cricket balls Pakistan should be congratulated on agreeing to play in Australia with the pink ball he said.
