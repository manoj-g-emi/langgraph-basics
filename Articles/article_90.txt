Heading: moodys upgrades pakistan bond rating

Article: KARACHI: Moodys upgraded Pakistans dollar bonds rating one notch from stable to positive on Wednesday on the back of the countrys improving macroeconomic indicators.The financial ratings firm said its decision came in view of Pakistans strengthening foreign exchange reserves.Pakistan has been trying to boost its flagging economy since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was elected nearly two years ago."Moody´s Investors Service has revised the outlook on Pakistan´s foreign currency government bond rating to positive from stable," the company said in a statement.Pakistan issued $1 billion in five-year Sukuk Bonds, the Islamic version of eurobonds, in November last year to boost foreign exchange reserves.In April 2014, the country issued $2 billion worth of eurobonds, in five and 10 year terms,Pakistan´s net foreign currency reserves with the central State Bank reached to $11.2 billion up to March 13, from just $3.2 billion in January 2014.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has voiced satisfaction with Pakistan´s progress on reforms required under a $6.6-billion bailout agreed in 2013.The loan came on condition that Pakistan -- which was suffering an energy crisis -- would carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s said continued success under the IMF programme would act as "upward triggers to the rating".The central State Bank of Pakistan on the weekend slashed its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point to eight percent.The bank noted that the economy was now on a more stable footing and was benefiting from the drop in world oil prices.
