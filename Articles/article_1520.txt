Heading: Sri Lanka win toss bowl against England

Article: DELHI:  Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews won the toss and chose to bowl against England in Super Ten Group One match of the World Twenty20 here at Feroz Shah Kotla ground on Saturday night.There was no Sachithra Senanayake, who has an outstanding record against England in one-day cricket with 14 wickets at 14.57 in ODIs. Nuwan Kulasekara was also omitted in favour of allrounder Dasun Shanaka.Alex Hales, who has recovered from a back complaint, replaced James Vince at the top of the England order.Defending champions Sri Lanka have to win to stay alive - barring the unlikely event of a no-result - leaving everything dependent on a final group game against South Africa. With just one game remaining, England will book their berth in the semi-finals with a victory, but a loss - by any margin - will see them eliminated since their net run rate is lower than that of South Africa.Teams:England: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Jos Buttler (wk), Eoin Morgan (captain), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Liam PlunkettSri Lanka: Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Milinda Siriwardana, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews (captain), Chamara Kapugedera, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Rangana Herath, Dushmantha Chameera, Jeffrey Vandersay
