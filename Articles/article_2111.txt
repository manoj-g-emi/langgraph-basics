Heading: Iceland stun England in one of greatest ever 

Article: strong>Nice: England were dealt a humiliating 2-1 defeat by minnows Iceland on Monday as Roy Hodgson´s side crashed out of Euro 2016 in one of the most stunning upsets in the history of the game.</strongRagnar Sigurdsson cancelled out Wayne Rooney´s fourth-minute opener before Kolbeinn Sigthorsson´s tame shot squirmed past England goalkeeper Joe Hart for an 18th-minute winner.<br/>Three days on from Britain´s vote to leave the European Union, England followed the country´s lead by exiting Europe, their quest for a first title since the 1966 World Cup doomed to continue.It ranked alongside their 1-0 loss to the part-timers of the United States at the 1950 World Cup and sent Iceland, appearing at their first major tournament, into a glamour quarter-final with hosts France.England manager Roy Hodgson is now almost certain to lose his job, with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke having said recently that the team would have to "do well" in France for him to be offered a new contract.Ironically, Hodgson´s fate was sealed by his former protege Lars Lagerback -- Iceland´s joint coach alongside Heimir Hallgrimsson -- who began his coaching career under the Englishman´s tutelage in Sweden in the late 1970s.As expected, Hodgson made six changes to his starting XI at a muggy Stade de Nice, which included a recall for Raheem Sterling.The Manchester City forward was criticised for some insipid group-stage displays, but he made an excellent start, racing onto Daniel Sturridge´s fine pass and drawing a foul from Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Halldorsson.Rooney planted the penalty into the bottom-left corner to crown his 115th England appearance -- which tied David Beckham´s record for an outfield player -- with a 53rd international goal.
