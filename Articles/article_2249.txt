Article: strong>LORDS: Pakistan were dismissed for 339 runs on day 2 of the first test match by a rejuvenated English side. </strongChris Woakes was the star of the day, who picked up crucial wickets to take his tally to six as he finished the lower half of the Pakistani batting order. Woakes dismissed Pakistani wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmad and Wahab Riaz on two successive deliveries. Mohammad Amir walked in on the hat-trick ball and managed to pull through. Amir walked into the Lords cricket stadium six years after his career had been jolted at the same venue due to the spot-fixing saga. Amir scored 12 runs from 10 balls, all three being boundaries. However, he was also dismissed in the end by Broad when he was caught by Root.
