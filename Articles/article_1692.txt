Heading: Afridi hopes to set up a proper cricket academy

Article: strong>Karachi: Shahid Afridi, who has been rested and has not been named for national training camp, said he was looking forward to playing as professional in the foreseeable future and wanted to set up his cricket academy as well.</strongI will continue to play cricket for my leagues, Afridi said in an interview with Rameez Raja for ICC Cricket 360°. I´ve signed with Hampshire County and will play that as well. PSL is also happening, and apart from that if I get any good opportunity I will take it. Also I would like to carry on with my charity work for my Shahid Afridi foundation and have an ambition to set up a proper academy.Afridi, who announced his ODI retirement after Pakistan´s quarter-final loss in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, continues to play the shortest format.After the team´s dismal show in World Twenty-20, former Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq has been brought in the PCB fold as chief selector. Inzamam has axed Ahmed Shahzad and Umar Akmal on the basis of their disciplinary conduct and has rested Afridi citing the reason that Pakistan will be playing few T20Is and he also wants to give chance to youngsters.When asked about the emerging talent pool in the country, Afridi said the Pakistan Super League was a great platform for youngsters keen to make a foray into the national side.The first Pakistan Super League was a great boost for Pakistan cricketers financially, and in terms of exposure as well, said Afridi.The talent is definitely there but we have to search and that will happen from academies. So we need to build proper academies in each city and the talented kids can use the facilities. Right now, the boys only learn once they get selected into the national team. For example, proper training, diving skills should be learnt at U16 and U19 level in the academies, he concluded.
