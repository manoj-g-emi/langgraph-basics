Heading: Argentina outclass Bolivia to reach last eig

Article: SEATTLE: Argentina maintained their 100 percent record at the Copa America Centenario on Tuesday with a 3-0 victory over hapless Bolivia.The tournament favorites, already assured of a quarter-final berth after wins over Chile and Panama, wrapped up their Group D campaign with an easy win at Seattle´s CenturyLink Field.The victory sees Argentina reach the last eight as group winners, handing them what in theory should be a straightforward assignment against Venezuela in Foxborough on Saturday.The two-time world champions are determined to end a 23-year wait for a major title after suffering agonizing defeats in the finals of the 2014 World Cup and last year´s Copa America.On current form few would bet against the South American giants, who could afford to omit Lionel Messi from their starting line-up following his hat-trick display against Panama.The match was effectively settled within the first quarter of an hour, with Tottenham Hotspur winger Erik Lamela opening the scoring with a deflected free-kick in the 13th minute.Two minutes later China-based forward Ezequiel Lavezzi marked his comeback from injury with a goal, volleying home from close range after Gonzalo Higuain´s downward header.Central defender Victor Cuesta made it 3-0 just after the half-hour, diverting home Lavezzi´s low cross in the 32nd minute.Argentina manager Gerardo Martino brought on Messi at half-time, and a one-sided second half soon became a question of when or if the Barcelona superstar could grab a 54th international goal to equal Gabriel Batistuta´s longstanding scoring record.However despite Argentina´s dominance, Messi was unable to add to his team´s tally, his best chance coming with a 25-yard curling freekick which flew just wide of the goal.
