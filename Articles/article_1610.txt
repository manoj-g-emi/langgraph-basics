My world is upside down. But I'm here to stay and I'm battling on!" Taylor said on his Twitter account.The middle order batsman played seven test matches and 27 one-day internationals for England and captained the side against Ireland in May last year."It is both shocking and saddening to hear that James' career has been cut short in such a sudden and unexpected manner," England team director Andrew Strauss said in a statement released by the ECB."Throughout his career, he has constantly impressed with his determination to make the absolute most of his ability, and it is immensely cruel that such a hard working player will be unable to fulfil his great potential in the international arena."The ECB will work closely with Nottinghamshire and together we will do everything possible to help James through this difficult period, and aid him in his recovery."
