Heading: Australia to blood two new pacemen for India one day opener

Article: PERTH: Uncapped pacemen Joel Paris and Scott Boland will make their international debuts for Australia in the first one-day match against India in Perth on Tuesday.The pair join Josh Hazlewood and fast bowling all-rounders Mitchell Marsh and James Faulkner in a pace-heavy attack at the WACA.Having lost Mitchell Starc to foot injuries for the entire home summer and fellow left-armer Mitchell Johnson to retirement in November, Australia fast-tracked 23-year-old Western Australian Paris into the side after impressing in domestic limited overs cricket.Johnson and Starc enjoyed success at the WACA using the ´Fremantle Doctor´, a dependable afternoon sea-breeze, to swing the ball into right-handed batsmen and Australia captain Steve Smith said that had come into calculations in picking Paris."Traditionally we like to play a left-armer here who can use the breeze and move the ball so hopefully he´ll be able to do that for us tomorrow," Smith told reporters in Perth on Monday.Boland, 26, was a surprise selection in Australia´s Test squad against West Indies and impressed with a seven-wicket innings haul for Victoria state against Western Australia at the WACA in November."His death bowling has been very impressive," Smith said. "I think he hits a yorker as well as anyone at the moment. He´s got a bit of pace to him so hopefully he can hurry up the Indian batters a bit."Smith also said he hoped the WACA would be back to its traditionally fast and bouncy ways after it was widely criticised for being a batsman´s paradise during the recent Test series against New Zealand.Over 1,600 runs were piled on in the five-day draw, with six centuries scored."It looks a little bit soft at the moment under foot," Smith said. "It´s obviously a day out from the game. We´ll wait and see how it looks tomorrow."But hopefully it´s got a bit more pace and bounce than the Test match we played here."I guess the WACA and Gabba have been a fortress for us in one-day and Test cricket for a while."Obviously it´s a bit different to what the Indians are used to back home. Hopefully we can exploit that early on."The Perth match is the first in a five-game series against India. (Reuters)
