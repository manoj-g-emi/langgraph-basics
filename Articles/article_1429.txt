Heading: New Zealand humble India by 47 ru

Article: NAGPUR: New Zealand spin trio demolished the batting power house of India to record a 47-run victory in the opening match of the World Twenty20 Super 10 here at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium on Tuesday night.Chasing an easy target of 127, India were bundled out for a mere 79 in 18.1 overs. All their batsmen failed to get into runs except captain Mahindra Singh Dhoni (30) and Virat Kohli (23) showed some resistance against the Kiwi spinners while Ravichandran Ashwin (10) was the only other batsman to get into the double figures.Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner captured four wickets for 11, his career best bowling figures, while leg-spinner Ish Sodhi bagged three for 18 and off-spinner Nathan McCullum claimed two for 15.Earlier, Corey Anderson top scored for New Zealand with 34 but it was Luke Ronchi´s (21 not out) 11-ball cameo that took them to a modest 126-7 after captain Kane Williamson won the toss and decided to bat first.Williamson read this pitch perfectly. He had the guts to leave out Boult, Southee and McClenaghan on this pitch and play Sodhi, Nathan McCullum and Santner, who beat India at their own game to give them a humbling defeat.This was Indias second lowest total in a T20 International as their record remains at 74 against Australia at Melbourne in 2008.India remain winless in T20 internationals against New Zealand, having lost five in five. New Zealand are the only side to whom India could not beat so far.
