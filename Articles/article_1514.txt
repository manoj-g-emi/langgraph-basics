Heading: WT20 Pakistan set tough 194 run target by Aussi

Article: MOHALI: Steven Smith, leading from the front, guided Australia to an imposing total of 193 for four against Pakistan in their crucial match in the World Twenty20 Super Ten Group Two here at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium on Friday.Australia lost three early wickets for 57 after captain Smith won the toss and  decided to bat first on the pitch with additional bounce.Usman Khawaja (21) and David Warner (9) were clean bowled by fast bowler Wahab Riaz while Aaron Finch (15) was bowled by left-arm spinner Imad Wasim.However, Smith along with Glenn Maxwell and later with Shane Watson lifted Australia to set a difficult target of 194 runs for Pakistan, who must win to stand any chance of staying in the tournament while an Australian victory would ensure that they do not need to worry about net run-rate ahead of their clash with India.This was the second highest total by Australia against Pakistan in a T20 International, after 197-7 they made at Gros Islet in May 2010.Smith made an unbeaten 61off 43 balls with seven fours while Maxwell scored 30 off 18 balls with three fours and a six before getting out, caught by Ahmed Shehzad off Imad.Both added 62 runs for the fourth wicket partnership and then Smith added another 74 runs for an unbeaten fifth wicket stand with the soon-to-retire Shane Watson, who also remained not out on 44 after hitting three sixes and four boundaries in a 21-ball innings.For Pakistan, Wahab and Imad claimed two wickets each while pacers Amir Khan, Mohamamd Sami and leg-spinner Shahid Afridi failed to get any wicket.
