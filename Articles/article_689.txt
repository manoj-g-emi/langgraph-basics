Heading: Germany slips out of global competitiveness top 10

Article: strong>Germany has slipped out of the top 10 most competitive economies in the world, falling two places to 12 from last year, a study by Swiss business school IMD showed on Monday.</strongThe study, based on a worldwide survey of 5,400 managers assessing 342 criteria, showed that a diminished assessment of Germany's government and the economy's performance were the main reasons for the drop, IMD director Arturo Bris said."The biggest danger for Germany is self-satisfaction," Bris said. "If it rejects that, it will get back into the top ten."Hong Kong came top in the survey this year, followed by Switzerland and the United States.
