Besides serving their respective terms in UK the trio has completed bans imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).At the time of spot fixing Amir was a juvenile. This can give him benefit and we may succeed in getting relaxation for him. He is a highly talented bowler. The world wants to see him in action. It is our utmost effort that he should travel with the team, the source added.
