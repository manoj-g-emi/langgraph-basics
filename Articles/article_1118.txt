Heading: Keys falls to Zhang Shuai at Australian O

Article: MELBOURNE -- A year after her finest Grand Slam to date, Madison Keys left this year's Australian Open in tears.Playing on an injured left leg, Keys fell to Zhang Shuai 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth round in Melbourne.In the second set, Keys began hobbling noticeably and called for treatment. She was unable to engage in long rallies and grimaced between points.With speculation she might retire, No. 15 Keys returned to the court, but the pain only seemed to increase. Already down a break, Keys doubled-faulted two times in a row, handing her Chinese opponent the set.Keys limped to her changeover chair, understandably frustrated, but this time did not call a trainer.Somehow, she managed to go up an early break at 2-1 in the third on a crushing 91 mph forehand return but was immediately broken back.After a quick hold from Zhang, a qualifier, Keys took another medical timeout. In the next game, she was visibly crying in pain. At that point, Keys could hardly move, lunging at shots just out of her reach.Zhang, 27, ultimately pulled away, ending the match on an overcooked forehand from Keys. The American hobbled off the court, her face in a towel, distraught at the outcome.More than an hour after her three-set loss, Keys gingerly walked to an area adjacent to the women's locker room with the assistance of her publicist.Keys, too injured to make the longer jaunt to the main interview roof, expressed her disappointment.In her last round, Keys strained an abdominal muscle, an injury she said also bothered her against Zhang.Amazingly, the 133rd-ranked Zhang had never advanced past the first round of a major in 14 previous attempts.
