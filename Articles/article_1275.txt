Heading: South Africa bowl first England recall Billings for Willey

Article: JOHANNESBURG: Faf du Plessis chose to chase for the second match in the T20 series as South Africa look to gain a "mental advantage over England." South Africa have won their last four matches batting second - three ODIs and the opening T20 - and du Plessis believes it has become a strong suit for a team that historically struggled when under pressure.South Africa made no changes to their winning XI from Cape Town which meant no space for Farhaan Behardien or Aaron Phangiso. Quinton de Kock is still being rested so Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers will get another chance to open together.England added some depth to their line-up with the inclusion of Sam Billings at the expense of David Willey. Reece Topley, who was reprimanded following his reactions to the last ball defeat at Newlands, kept his place.Earlier, England Women won chasing a low total on a cracked pitch that took some turn. But the skies have cleared and the afternoon is hot and runs aplenty are expected in this game.South Africa:  AB de Villiers (wk), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis (captain), JP Duminy, Rilee Rossouw, David Miller, David Wiese, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Imran TahiEngland: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (captain), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Sam Billings, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley.
