Heading: South Africa bat in decider against Australi

Article: CAPE TOWN: After South Africa's success chasing in recent matches, Faf du Plessis decided they needed to have another go at defending a total and opted to set Australia a target on a slow Newlands pitch. South Africa opted to rest AB de Villiers and give Hashim Amla an opportunity to open with Quinton de Kock.That was one of three changes South Africa made to their XI. Rilee Rossouw was given another chance with Farhaan Behardien missing out and South Africa dispensed with one of their allrounders to fit Kyle Abbott into the XI. Abbott was included ahead of Chris Morris.Australia also changed their top two and left out Aaron Finch to allow Usman Khawaja to open with his Sydney team-mate Shane Watson. Their other changes came in the bowling department with Adam Zampa returning in Ashton Agar's place and Nathan Coulter-Nile displacing Josh Hazlewood.South Africa: Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock (wk), Faf du Plessis (captain), JP Duminy, David Miller, Rilee Rossouw,  David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Dale Steyn, Imran TahiAustralia: Shane Watson, Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Steve Smith (captain), Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, James Faulkner, Peter Nevill (wk), Adam Zampa, John Hastings, +Nathan Coulter-Nile
