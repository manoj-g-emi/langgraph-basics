Article: strong>CHRISTCHURCH: Tom Latham and Kane Williamson steered New Zealand to 43 for one in their second innings at tea on Monday, after Martin Guptill went for a duck, as the hosts reduced Australia's lead on the third day of the second test to 92 runs.</strongNew Zealand were in trouble on eight for one when Guptill failed to move his feet and nibbled a catch through to Peter Nevill from James Pattinson.However, Latham and Williamson steadied the ship, reaching 33 and 10 respectively at the break.New Zealand, who posted 370 in their first innings, struggled to break down Australia's batting for more than four sessions but took five wickets in the first hour after lunch.The visitors had gone to lunch at 455 for five before Neil Wagner added the wickets of Adam Voges (60) and Mitchell Marsh (18) to the two he took on Sunday.Wagner then completed his second five-wicket haul when he had Nevill caught by wicketkeeper BJ Watling for 13, and then Josh Hazlewood caught at first slip by Brendon McCullum for the same score to end Austrlia's innings on 505.Wagner finished the innings with career-best figures of 6-106.Corey Anderson took the other wicket to fall after lunch, with Pattinson caught at point by Trent Boult, in New Zealand's most successful period in the two-match series.Spectators at the venue observed a minute's silence at 1251 (2351 GMT) to commemorate the fifth anniversary of a devastating earthquake in Christchurch that killed 185 people.Players from both sides wore black arm-bands for the day's play and stood while the big screen displayed a message remembering those who died.New Zealand's only success in the first session was when nightwatchman Nathan Lyon was well caught low down at slip by McCullum from part-time spinner Williamson for 33.Lyon and Voges had combined for 81 runs to frustrate New Zealand, with McCullum using seven different bowlers in the session in a bid to break through. The skipper even made a rare visit to the bowling crease himself, producing four overs of slow medium pace for three runs.Australia hold a 1-0 lead in the two-match series and only need to draw at Hagley Oval to retake the world's top ranking in test cricket.
