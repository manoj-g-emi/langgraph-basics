Article: KARACHI: The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) plummeted over 1,000 points during intra-day trading on Monday, with investors at the Pakistani bourse in a cautious mood as Asian markets also stayed on edge ahead of key data on the slowing Chinese economy.The benchmark KSE 100-share index was down 3.17 per cent, or 1073.78 points, trading at 32817.30 at around 2:00PM.Traders said that, after flight of foreign investment, local investors had also begun to withdraw their capital from the market.Analysts largely attributed the bearish trend at the KSE to declines at other Asian markets and continuing political uncertainty in Pakistan.AFP adds: Stock markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong gave up early gains to end lower Monday as dealers await fresh Chinese economic data this week, amid fears weak figures will spark more turmoil.Shanghai's benchmark index fell 2.52 percent, or 79.75 points, to 3,080.42.
