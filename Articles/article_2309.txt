Heading: Farah displays Olympic credentials with London victory

Article: LONDON: Britain´s double Olympic champion Mo Farah produced a devastating 5,000m display on Saturday at the Diamond League event in London to prove he is in top form heading into the Rio Olympics.The 33-year-old showed exactly why he is the favourite to defend his two Olympic titles in Brazil next month with a stunning example of speed and stamina at the Olympic stadium.His time of 12 minutes and 59.29 seconds was the fastest mark of the year, and the fourth time in his career that he has dipped under 13 minutes.Most ominously for those trying to catch him, particularly the Kenyans, this was his fastest time in the discipline since before the London 2012 Olympics.Farah made his move after 3600m and never looked back, making the final 1400m appear almost like celebratory laps of honour. He crossed the finishing line by doing his trademark Mobot celebration.Fellow Briton Andrew Butchart was second in a time of 13:14.85, with American Bernard Lagat third in a season´s best 13:14.96."This is amazing, I got amazing support from the crowd," said Farah. "I wanted to do it for them."This is my last chance before Rio, this track has so much meaning to me. Not many athletes can do it in their home town."This is my best form (heading into a major event). I am in good shape. I have to keep my feet on the ground. Anything can happen over the next two-and-a-half weeks. I have to stay patient and cool."Dutchwoman Dafne Schippers consolidated her position as the number one sprinter in the Diamond League format by winning the women´s 200m.The world champion, who ran the third-fastest time in history in Beijing last year, crossed the line in 22.13sec - half a second ahead of American Tiffany Townsend.Marie-Josee Ta Lou of the Ivory Coast set a personal best of 10.96sec to cruise to victory in the women´s 100m.Trinidadian Michelle-Lee Ahye was second (10.99sec) while Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Jamaica´s 2008 and 2012 Olympic champion, was behind the pace in 11.06sec.
