Heading: Malinga acted against medical advice by doctor

Article: strong>COLOMBO: Injured Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga is believed to have acted against the medical advice given by another Sri Lankan doctor Siri Kannangara.</strongI had examined Malinga in January during my two trips in Sri Lanka and had advised him to take minimum six-months rest. This six-month period can still exceed. The period is still not over now and I wonder why he chose to play in the Asia Cup. Dr. Kannangara told the Sri Lankan newspaper, daily Mirror over telephone from Austrailia.Malinga, had played one match against UAE (at Mirpur) in February-- the very next month after the advice was given to him by the specialist and may have aggregated the injury.Doctor Kannangara said had Malinga listened to his advice, he may have been on a better recovery path. I had prescribed him a few Intra-Vein injections (not cortisone). I dont know whether Malinga did take these injections or consulted any other doctor and decided to play.  That was his decision and I cant comment on this, he added. Dr. Kannangara is likely to arrive in Sri Lanka next month before going to London. I will not advise Malinga unless and until my advice is sought, by him doctor clarified.Dr. Kannangara has treated a few international cricketers including Indias Sachin Tendulkar. Sri Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaas had advised Tendulkar to consult me and I treated him for his back pain. Viv and Barry Richards, Clive Lloyd and many other ex-players have been successfully treated by Dr. Siri Kannangara.  Meanwhile, the report on Lasith Malingas fitness has been submitted to the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) board by three specialists.
