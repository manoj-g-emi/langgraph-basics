Heading: Elliott helps Quetta restrict Karachi to 126 9

Article: SHARJAH: Right-arm medium pacer of Quetta Gladiators Grant Elliot played havoc with the ball to restrict Karachi Kings to 126 for nine in the 14th Twenty20 match of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) here at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Saturday.After Karachi Kings skipper Shoaib Malik won the toss and elected to bat first, his players  batted poorly as only four batsmen entered into the double figures.However, Shoaib himself was the top scorer with 45, scored off 38 balls with three fours and two sixes. He was followed by James Vince (23), Ravi Bopara (14) and Shakib Al Hasan (10).Their most in-form batsman and the allround star of the previous match Bopara also failed to make any significant contribution.Elliot cmpleted his bowling quota of four runs capturing four wickets for just 15 runs.
