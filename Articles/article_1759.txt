Heading: Cook eyes big milestone of 10 000 Test ru

Article: LEEDS: England captain Alastair Cook said Wednesday he was well aware that his looming membership of the 10,000 Test- run club would be a significant landmark in an already successful career.The 31-year-old left-handed opener needs just 36 more runs to become the first Englishman   and only 12th player overall   to score 10 000 runs in Tests and he will hope to get there during this week s first Test against Sri Lanka at Headingley which starts on Thursday.It would mean a lot and hopefully I can get there sooner rather than later so we can talk about something else, said Cook speaking at Headingley, Yorkshires headquarters, in Leeds, northern England on Wednesday.It s a big milestone in terms of the people who have done it previously so it would be great to try and score these 36 runs.Ive just got to put that to bed after this press conference and try and do what Ive done in the previous 10 years which is just try and concentrate on that ball coming down and nothing else.The last time England played Sri Lanka in a Test at Headingley two years ago, was one of the low points of Cooks career.Sri Lanka, inspired by a brilliant hundred from captain Angelo Mathews,   still their skipper,   won a thrilling match by 100 runs off the penultimate ball of the game to secure their first Test series win in England.Cooks tactics were widely criticised and he pondered resigning the England captaincy.
