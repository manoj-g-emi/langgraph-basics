Article: Professional Pakistani boxer Muhammad Waseem Khan on Sunday clinched the World Boxing Council (WBC) Silver Flyweight title in a tough fight against Philippines' Jether Oliva at the Millenium Hilton Hotel in Seoul.President Mamnoon Hussain, Chief Minister Balochistan Sanaullah Zehri, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and other leaders congratulated the boxer over his win. Balochistan Sports Minister Mir Mujeebur Rehman announced a Rs0.5 million prize for Muhammad Waseem after his victory.Initially it was an ordinary fight but WBC last month turned it into a world silver title fight. The victory catapults the 28-year-old Pakistani boxer among the top four in the world.Muhammad Waseem, who hails from Quetta, prepared for the fight under famous trainer Jeff Mayweather at the boxing club of renowned boxer Floyd Mayweather Junior in Las Vegas. Jeff is the uncle of Floyd Mayweather Junior, one of the worlds greatest boxers of his time.Waseem comes across as one of the most capable and promising young boxers that Pakistan has produced in recent times.Before this match, Waseem had played only three fights and won them all.The Pakistani boxer, who switched over to pro boxing early last year, made a dream debut when he knocked out.Koreas Min Wook Lee in the ninth round to win the Korean Boxing Commission (KBC) title on October 4, 2015.He knocked out Suparyanto Doglo of Indonesia in the third round in his second bout in Bangkok on December 5, 2015.His last triumph came against Indonesias Bajawa whom he knocked out in Seoul the other month.Waseem is a rare fighter as he began his pro career directly with a ten-round fight. He opted to do so because he had the confidence as he had won several international medals, including an Asian Games bronze, during his amateur career which was hurt by lack of resources and politics within the Pakistan Boxing Federation (PBF).
