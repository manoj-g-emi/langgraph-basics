Heading: Australia to add pink ball against Pakistan South Afri

Article: SYDNEY: A revamp of home international scheduling will mean Brisbane loses the first Test of next summer and pink ball matches will be played against both touring nations, South Africa and Pakistan, Aussies media reported on Wednesday.Cricket Australia is finalising its international domestic and Big Bash League schedules for the 2016-17 season with an announcement expected this month.There are changes a foot with the Gabba to forfeit hosting rights to the first Test of the season and instead feature elsewhere in the calendar as host to the opening match of the Australia-Pakistan series set to be a day-night match in December.In its place, the Test summer will kick off between Australia and South Africa at the WACA in November with the ability for the match to be beamed into lounge rooms on the east coast at prime time weighing heavily in Perths favour.The series against the Proteas will head to Hobart which has been retained as a Test venue next summer amid competition from Canberra before wrapping up under lights at Adelaide Oval, the scene of last years historic first pink ball Test.Australia will then meet Pakistan in a day-night match at the Gabba and complete that series with marquee Tests in Melbourne and Sydney.Brisbane has struggled to attract decent Test crowds outside Ashes years but by beginning the summer in Perth, there is a belief that attendance numbers should be boosted by the citys strong expatriate South African population.By holding a second day-night Test in Brisbane officials hope to replicate the success of the inaugural pink ball showpiece between Australia and New Zealand last November.Another key point of contention had been whether Canberra would be granted a first-ever Test. There was a strong bid from Cricket ACT and the concept of Canberra hosting a five-day match had the support of some senior officials.Manuka Oval is understood to be in CAs thinking as a future Test venue but for now will have to be content with hosting another one-day international as Blundstone Arena is given another chance.
