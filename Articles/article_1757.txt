Heading: T20 drama Ben Stokes better cricketer Stuart Broad

Article: strong>LONDON: England all-rounder Ben Stokes will learn from his dreadful World Twenty20 experience and come back a stronger player, team mate Stuart Broad has said.</strongStokes was hit for four successive sixes by West Indies´ Carlos Brathwaite in the last over of the T20 final, the onslaught ending England´s hopes of a second title.Broad, the world´s top-ranked test bowler, was famously blasted for six sixes by India´s Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 tournament but used the setback as motivation and has backed Stokes to follow suit."I wouldn´t be the bowler I am now without that experience," Broad told British media."You´re dead right, people would have been sat there thinking: ´Why did you go that way?´"But you´ve got to go with what you feel is your strength, so as a player you´ll always have things you are confident in.I prefer a player to get it wrong going for something they believe is their strength than going to something that isn´t."Don´t be surprised if Stokesy now performs at a really high level because he´ll realise what went wrong and channel it the right way -- he has an amazing talent."England kicks off their three-match home test series against Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday, which will be followed by an ODI series.
