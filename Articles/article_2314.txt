Heading: Australia pick spin twins for Sri Lanka opener

Article: PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka: Australian captain Steve Smith named spin twins Nathan Lyon and Steve O´Keefe in his line-up Monday for the series opener against Sri Lanka as the newly-crowned kings of Test cricket look to cement their supremacy.On the day that Australia were presented with the mace as the world number one side, Smith took the unusual move of naming his starting XI a day before the start of the first Test in Pallekele, near Kandy.Australia´s rise up the rankings has been based in large part on the performance of their fast bowlers such as Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and they rarely field more than one spinner.But after taking 10 wickets in a warm-up last week, O´Keefe has been picked to play only his third Test alongside the more experienced Nathan Lyon -- his close friend and Sheffield Shield teammate."Both our spinners bowled well in the practice game. They have played lot of games for New South Wales and they are close friends. It´s going to be exciting," Smith told reporters in Pallekele, on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia have hired local spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan as a consultant for the series, well aware of Sri Lanka´s reputation for producing turning pitches.Smith said that cracks had already appeared on the Pallekele strip which should also benefit Sri Lanka´s premier spinner Rangana Herath."The wicket will take spin for sure here. Not sure about the first innings, but it looks very dry and lots of cracks on it. It certainly will help spin bowlers," Smith added."They (Sri Lanka) have some quality spinners in their rank led by Rangana Herath. He has done really well in these conditions. The batters need to have some good plans against him at what he is going to bring at us."Smith confirmed that vice-captain David Warner will play after being sidelined for six weeks with a broken left index finger.Mathews held back from naming his starting XI and was instead cursing a new round of injury woes to an already depleted squad.Fast bowler Suranga Lakmal complained of a stiff hamstring after training on Sunday before the uncapped Dhananjaya de Silva hurt his finger during fielding drills, Mathews revealed.Australia XI: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Joe Burns, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill, Steve O´Keeffe, Mitchell Starc, Adam VogesSri Lanka squad: Angelo Mathews (captain), Dinesh Chandimal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Janith Perera, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Lakshan Sandakan, Suranga Lakmal
