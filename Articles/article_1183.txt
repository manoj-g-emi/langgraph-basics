Heading: Brendon McCullum dismissed for 47 in final one day inning

Article: strong>Brendon McCullum's final one-day international innings ended as spectacularly as it began when the New Zealand captain was dismissed for 47 in the series finale against Australia in Hamilton on Monday.</strongMcCullum, who had hit six fours and three sixes in his 27-ball innings, was well caught by John Hastings at mid-off after charging down the wicket at fast bowling all rounder Mitchell Marsh only to miscue the shot.The 34-year-old was given a standing ovation at the sold out Seddon Park as he walked off and he gave heir apparent Kane Williamson a fist bump in a symbolic passing of the baton.McCullum will retire from all internationals after the second test against Steve Smith's side in Christchurch and he has been greeted by enthusiastic crowds throughout the one-day series, lauding his contribution to the game.On Monday McCullum battled to suppress his emotions during the coin toss, which he unsurprisingly lost, and was greeted by a guard of honour by the Australians with Smith shaking his hand.After being initially cautious, his first four scoring shots were boundaries.His first six, off Scott Boland, was a beautifully timed shot over long off. He hit Boland for two more sixes in the right armer's next over with the second dispatched over mid-wicket to bring up his 200th one-day international six.He is just the fourth player to hit 200 one-day sixes but the only one to have 100 in test cricket as well.He hit his sixth boundary off Mitchell Marshall in the 10th over when he guided the ball to the vacant third man boundary but was dismissed on the next ball with New Zealand 84-1
