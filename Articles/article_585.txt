It plans to build a new cement plant in the north region of the country to meet growing demand.  The panned plant will be the companys third production facility in the country. The company earlier said an initial work of the new plant worth $200 million is progressing fast and it is in talks with the Punjab government to acquisition land for the project. Similarly, it is also in the process of negotiating contract with the equipment suppliers.Lucky cement has also initiated a $240 million plant in the Democratic Republic of Congo in June 2013. The construction work at the project site is in full swing to achieve planned commercial operations date of October 2016, the statement said.The effect of 50 percent share of the net assets of the Congo plant has been reflected in the consolidated unaudited condensed financial statements of the company for the nine months period ended March 31, 2016.
