Heading: Easy win for first boxing pro in Games history

Article: Rio de Janeiro: Italy´s Carmine Tommasone on Saturday became the first professional in history to step in to an Olympic boxing ring -- and celebrated by teaching his opponent a harsh lesson in Rio.Tommasone, 32, who came into the lightweight bout with a perfect 15-0 record, simply had too much speed, power and guile for Mexico´s Lindolfo Delgado and was deservedly awarded a unanimous points decision by the judges at ringside.The Italian hurt the taller Mexican, 21, in round two with a clumping overhand right that had Delgado smiling and urging the Italian to bring it on -- begrudging recognition that the punch hurt.He continued to bamboozle Delgado in the third and final round, hitting the Mexican around with combinations that Delgado had no reply to."I am very proud," Tommasone said of being the first boxing pro at an Olympics.<br/> "I was asked by my federation to come to the Olympics and I was very happy to do so -- for me, it´s the most important competition in the world."The decision to include professionals at the Olympics only came in June and was met with a chorus of disapproval.Only three professionals including Tommasone made it to Rio.
