Heading: Australias Starc can pass 300 wickets McDer

Article: strong>NEW DELHI: Former Australia cricketer and bowling coach Craig McDermott has heaped praise on Mitchell Starc ahead of a Test series in Sri Lanka, predicting the pacer will easily cross the 300-wicket mark.</strongStarc has bagged 91 wickets from 25 Tests so far in his international career, and Australian coach Darren Lehmann is among those who have already said the 26-year-old can eventually reach the milestone."I think that´s underselling him," McDermott told AFP this week in New Delhi where he is promoting his sports academy."I think Mitchell can certainly sail past the 300-wicket mark and can get many more.""And I would love to be there to shake his hand when he passes 300 because it´s a hell of a milestone for any bowler," said McDermott, who recently quit as Australia´s bowling coach.The lanky pacer, who missed the second half of Australia´s Test summer and the World Twenty20 in India with an ankle injury, will be looking to get his rhythm back in the first Test in Pallekele starting on July 26.Starc made an impressive one-day comeback in the recent West Indies tri-series, with eight wickets in five games, helping Australia to clinch the title.The New South Welshman is just two shy of 100 one-day international scalps from 51 matches, with an impressive average of 19.79 and an economy rate of 4.82."I think he is getting one-day wickets for fun. Certainly his Test bowling is improving every time he takes the field for Australia," said McDermott, who himself just fell short of the 300 milestone, claiming 291 Test wickets during his 12-year career for Australia.
