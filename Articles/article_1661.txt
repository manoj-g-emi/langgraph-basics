Heading: ICC blasts West Indies for World T20 outburst over pay

Article: strong>MELBOURNE: The International Cricket Council has criticised West Indies for using their victory speech at the World Twenty20 tournament to complain about their cricket board after a long drawn-out pay dispute.</strongDuring the televised broadcast, West Indies captain Darren Sammy referred to the dispute which saw the team threaten to withdraw from the tournament in India before a last-minute deal was brokered with the board.All-rounder Dwayne Bravo later criticised the West Indies Cricket Board in an interview with a local broadcaster."The (ICC) Board considered the behaviour of some of the West Indies players in the immediate aftermath of the final, and unanimously agreed that certain comments and actions were inappropriate, disrespectful and brought the event into disrepute," the ICC said."The Board acknowledged an apology by the WICB but was disappointed to note that such behaviour had detracted from the success of what was otherwise a magnificent tournament and final."The ICC added that "serious consideration" had been given to bringing code of conduct charges against the players.After West Indies´ four-wicket win over England in Kolkata, skipper Sammy said in an interview: "People were wondering whether we would play this tournament."We had a lot of issues, we felt disrespected by our board ..I´m yet to hear from (them). That is very disappointing.
