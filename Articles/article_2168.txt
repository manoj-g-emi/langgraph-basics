Heading: Inzamam blasts Cook comments Mohammad Amir

Article: strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq has critisised the England captain Alastair Cook over his comments on pacer Mohammad Amir.</strongThe England captain had hinted Amir will have to face 'consequences' in the form of a hostile reception when he plays the first Test at Lord's from July 14.While talking to Geo Tv on Monday, Inzamam asked, ""How would the England captain feel if they were in Pakistan and our captain made a similar statement about some player?""I see this as the start of a campaign to start pressuring Amir. Because not only England but even Australia and South Africa see him as a threat. And he can be a match-winner in England," Inzamam said.The chief selector said he would advise Misbah-ul-Haq to take some steps to counter this pressure."I think it would be a good idea if Amir was not made to field at the boundaries because he will then face hostile comments and remarks. It is best to keep him away from the crowd at the start," he said."But to me there is sympathy for Amir in England and the best way he can answer is to perform in the series and I am confident he can do it," added the former captain.
