Heading: Sri Lanka bowl against England in final ODI

Article: CARDIFF, United Kingdom:  Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews won the toss and elected to field against England in the fifth and final one-day international at Cardiff on Saturday.England had already won the series at 2-0 up with one to play following their dynamic six-wicket win in a rain-affected match at The Oval where opener Jason Roy made 162 on his Surrey home ground.England made two changes, with Roy´s opening partner Alex Hale ruled out with a back niggle.Hales was replaced by James Vince with off-spinner Moeen Ali making way for an extra seamer in Chris Jordan on a green-tinged pitch.Sri Lanka made one change, left-arm seamer Chaminda Bandara coming for his debut in place of dropped all-rounder Farveez Maharoof as the tourists went in search of their first win on English soil this trip following a 2-0 defeat in the preceding three-Test series.No sooner had Mathews won the toss then it began to rain again. But the scheduled start of play was pushed back by just 10 minutes to 10:40am local time (0940 GMT), with no overs lost at that stage.Teams<br/> England: James Vince, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (captain), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler (wkt), Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Adil RashidSri Lanka: Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal (wkt), Angelo Mathews (captain), Seekkuge Prasanna, Upul Tharanga, Dasun Shanaka, Chaminda Bandara, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga LakmalUmpires: Paul Reiffel (AUS), Michael Gough (ENG), TV umpire: Bruce Oxenford (AUS)<br/> Match referee: David Boon (AUS)
