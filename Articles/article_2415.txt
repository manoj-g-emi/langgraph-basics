Article: strong>Rio de Janeiro: Andy Murray came perilously close to "poking out the eye" of Britain´s Princess Anne in a botched dress rehearsal for Friday´s Olympic Games opening ceremony where he will carry the country´s flag.</strongTennis star Murray, the defending Olympic champion, will lead out the British team in what he describes as one of the proudest moments of his career.But the 29-year-old admitted that Wednesday night´s photo-call with the daughter of Britain´s Queen Elizabeth, and other members of the team, could have gone a lot better."I ended up putting the flag in front of Princess Anne´s face," said the Wimbledon champion.<br/>"The flag is huge and as soon as I tipped it, it was covering someone´s face."It has a big, sharp point on top of it and she said something like ´make sure you don´t poke my eye out´."I hope she was OK. I didn´t mean to do it. I was just following instructions. Last night didn´t go well. I´ll have to try and get more practice in before tomorrow."
