Heading: Gomez guides Germany into Euro 2016 knockou

Article: strong>PARIS: Mario Gomez struck as world champions Germany beat Northern Ireland 1-0 in Paris on Tuesday to qualify for the Euro 2016 knockout phase as winners of Group C.</strongDrafted in to address the goal-scoring problems witnessed in Germany´s 0-0 draw with Poland, the on-loan Besiktas striker netted from Thomas Mueller´s pass in the 30th minute at Parc des Princes.That Germany did not win more handsomely was due largely to the excellence of Northern Irish goalkeeper Michael McGovern.But it was enough to preserve their position at the top of the group on goal difference above Poland, who beat Ukraine by the same scoreline in Marseille.Joachim Loew´s side will now turn their thoughts to a last 16 tie against either Albania, Slovakia or the third-place team in Group F -- which is yet to conclude -- in Lille on Sunday.Michael O´Neill´s Northern Ireland, meanwhile, must wait to have their qualification confirmed.They finished third in the group, but their 2-0 win over Ukraine last week puts them in a strong position to go through as one of the four best third-place teams in what is their first European Championship finals.O´Neill kept faith with the team that had overcome Ukraine, but whereas his side had set the tempo in Lyon, they were immediately on the back foot against Germany.With full-backs Jonas Hector and Joshua Kimmich pushing high up on either flank and Jerome Boateng and Toni Kroos lofting passes behind the Northern Irish defence, Germany effectively took up residence in the final third.
