Article: strong>Tokyo: Asian stocks were subdued on Tuesday, with Japanese and South Korean equities slipping, after crude oil prices resumed their slide and cooled investor sentiment.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were effectively unchanged, and looked set for a loss of around 12 percent for the year.Japan's Nikkei lost 0.3 percent and South Korea's KOSPI fell 0.4 percent. Australian stocks bucked the trend and rose 0.4 percent.On Monday, prices of both Brent and U.S. crude dropped more than 3 percent, reversing a brief rebound and dragging U.S. energy shares down 1.8 percent as the worst performing of the major S&amp;P sectors.Brent was at $36.60 a barrel, near an 11-year low of $35.98 struck last week.The Dow dipped 0.1 percent and the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.2 percent overnight after trading resumed following the Christmas break, but activity is expected to remain thin until after the long New Year holiday weekend.In currencies, the dollar edged down 0.1 percent to 120.33 yen, within striking distance of a two-month low of 120.05 struck late last week.The greenback has been sapped by profit taking after the Federal Reserve this month hiked interest rates for the first time in nine years.
