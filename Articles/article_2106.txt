Heading: Pakistan coach Arthur undaunted Australia ax

Article: strong>SOUTHAMPTON United Kingdom: Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur has arrived back in England saying that while he may have learnt from his time in charge of Australia it will not alter his fundamental approach to the job.</strongArthurs last tour of England saw him sacked as Australia coach just weeks before the start of the 2013 Ashes following the team s unsuccessful Champions Trophy campaign.But many believed Arthur who made his name internationally as coach of his native South Africa was paying the price for the so called homework gate affair in March that year after four players including all rounder Shane Watson were dropped for the third Test after failing to complete a written assignment.Now his major challenge is to get the best out of a talented Pakistan that includes Mohammad Amir with the left arm paceman set to return at Lord s next month for his first Test since the 2010 spot fixing scandal on the ground which led to five year bans and jail terms for him new ball colleague Mohammad Asif and then captain Salman Butt.Arthur speaking at Hampshire s headquarters ground where the Pakistan squad was training on Monday believes he has absorbed the lessons of his Australia exit even if he is unhappy with the way it was portrayed in public.You go back and analyse and think about it and Ive obviously learnt a hell of a lot from that experience, said Arthur.But I haven t changed my style because I don t think you could compromise on what you think is the right way to work ... on your core values and principles.The 48 year old added I am sick and tired of talking about homework gate and the way its been reported is totally way off the pace of what happened.But in terms of running teams there are ways of doing it   and that s how you get your ultimate success.The rest of the world has long admired the sheer depth of natural cricket talent in Pakistan and having had a few weeks in his new job Arthur is no exception.It has been an eye opener, he said. The skill levels the Pakistan team has are unbelievable.
