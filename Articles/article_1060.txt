Heading: Record breakers Guptill Munro lead NZ 

Article: AUCKLAND:  Colin Munro blasted New Zealand´s fastest Twenty20 half century to surpass a mark set by Martin Guptill earlier in the innings as the hosts swept their two-match series against Sri Lanka with a nine-wicket win in Auckland on Sunday.Guptill first rewrote the record books when he took just 19 deliveries to bring up his eighth half century in the shortest form of the game before he was eventually dismissed for 63 after smashing six boundaries and five sixes.His mark was then eclipsed by Munro some 20 minutes later when the left hander hit his seventh six to take New Zealand to 147 for one, the hosts chasing down Sri Lanka´s 142-8 total at Eden Park in just 10 overs.Munro´s half century came off 14 balls, the second fastest in international cricket behind India´s Yuvraj Singh (12 balls).He hit one four along with his seven maximums to finish unbeaten on exactly 50.The 2-0 series defeat also ensured Sri Lanka, the 2014 World Twenty20 champions, were replaced by West Indies at the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 rankings.Sri Lanka´s innings had been held together by Test and one-day captain Angelo Mathews´ 81 not out, his highest score in the format, while opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a streaky 28.No other batsmen got into double figures.As in most of the limited overs matches on the tour, Sri Lanka´s top order failed to get their innings going, slumping to 39-3 in the seventh over.Their normally reliable, and deep, middle order also failed to capitalise on Eden Park´s small boundaries as New Zealand´s bowlers varied their pace, line, length and flight, with part-time medium pacer Grant Elliott taking 4-22.The sixth Twenty20 World Cup takes place in India from March 8 to April 3.
