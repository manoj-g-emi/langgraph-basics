Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies -- manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies - to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform."The companies said they plan to begin testing by the end of this year, joining autonomous vehicles from Google´s Waymo, Uber and others being used in real-traffic situations.BMW Group will be responsible for driving control, safety and the production of the car platform.Intel will offer its Intel Go computing platform that uses a variety of sensors and other data to power the brains of the car.Mobileye will be using its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor which gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization."From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said."That´s why this partnership is breaking new ground. We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability."<br/>
