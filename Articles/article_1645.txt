Heading: Determined Yuvraj sets 2019 World Cup g

Article: strong>MUMBAI: Once a limited-overs giant, Yuvraj Singh has been in and out of the Indian team in recent years but the all-rounder believes he still has enough cricket in him to look forward to the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales.</strongThe 34-year-old left-handed batsman has seen it all in an international career that started as an 18-year-old in the 50-over ICC KnockOut Trophy in 2000. He was crucial for India during their 2007 World Twenty20 victory in South Africa and was also player-of-the-tournament in the team´s 50-over World Cup win on home soil in 2011.But later in 2011 he was told he had a golf ball-sized non-malignant tumour in his lungs.It was later re-diagnosed as a cancerous condition called "mediastinal seminoma".That started a phase of comebacks for the hard-hitting middle-order batsman, once considered a certainty in the international limited-overs formats."I think it´s the passion for the game," Yuvraj told Reuters when asked what kept him going."I don´t want to sit one day and think ´Oh, I should have played a few more years´."I want to end where I feel this is it and this is how much I would have played.Given the opportunity, I still feel I have a few more years to excel."
