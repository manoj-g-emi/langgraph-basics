Heading: Australia beat West Indies to claim tri nation seri

Article: BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: A match-winning three-wicket bowling stint by Mitchell Marsh lifted Australia to a convincing victory by 58 runs against West Indies in the final of the triangular one-day international (ODI) series in Barbados on Sunday.Australia, who batted first after winning the toss, seemed destined to post a middling target until wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, batting at number seven, rattled off an unbeaten 57 off 52 balls.He finished his stint at the crease in style with a towering six over mid wicket off the final ball as the visitors scored 270 for nine from their allotted 50 overs.The Windies made a breezy start in reply as openers Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher put on a quick 49, with Charles scoring the lion´s share of the runs at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown.But the floodgates opened after Fletcher (9) was caught at slip off paceman Josh Hazlewood, as medium-pacer Marsh collected three quick wickets to turn the match decisively and inexorably in Australia´s direction.Marsh dismissed Darren Bravo (6) and Marlon Samuels (6) cheaply, before trapping Charles (45) plum leg-before-wicket to leave the Windies staggering at 72 for four.Marsh finished with 3-32 off 10 miserly overs, while Hazlewood (5-50) mopped up the tail as the home team were all out for 212 after 48.4 overs.The result cements Australia´s number one ODI ranking, while eighth-ranked West Indies might take some consolation from reaching the final ahead of South Africa, the other team in the 10-match series.Hazlewood was named man of the series for his 11-wicket haul.Next up for West Indies is a four-Test home series against India starting on July 21, while Australia start a three-Test series in Sri Lanka on July 26.
