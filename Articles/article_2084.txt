Heading: Colombia down US to grab Copa third 

Article: GLENDALE, United States: AC Milan striker Carlos Bacca scored the only goal as Colombia defeated the United States 1-0 to clinch third place in the Copa America Centenario here Saturday.Bacca, 29, bundled home the winner on 31 minutes, nudging in from close range to settle a hard-fought contest.The US, beaten 4-0 by Argentina in the semi-finals on Tuesday, rallied desperately to get back into the game but ultimately were frustrated by some superb goalkeeping from David Ospina.It was the second time the US had been beaten by Colombia in this tournament.The Colombians also defeated them 2-0 in the tournament´s opening match.Colombia had gone closest to scoring first, Real Madrid star James Rodriguez being denied by a fine Tim Howard save on 12 minutes.Rodriguez was the architect for Colombia´s goal just after the half hour mark, chipping a wonderful pass into the path of Santiago Arias, who headed across the six yard box for Bacca to score.The US responded gamely to the setback however, with Jermaine Jones almost equalising when his low shot deflected off Arias and just missed the target.Seattle Sounders veteran Clint Dempsey, arguably the best US player of the tournament, had another good game but was unable to add to his Copa tally of three goals and three assists.Dempsey almost laid on a goal for Hamburg´s Bobby Wood, but the Bundesliga-based striker was unable to get his shot away cleanly.Dempsey produced the best American chance of the second half, with his long-range curling free-kick drawing a brilliant save from Ospina, clawing the ball away one-handed as it rocketed towards the top corner.The final of the Copa America takes place on Sunday, with Argentina facing Chile in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
