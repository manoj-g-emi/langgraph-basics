Heading: Hales century holds England together

Article: CAPE TOWN: Alex Hales hit a century while the rest of his England teammates struggled in the fifth and final one day international against South Africa at Newlands on Sunday.Opening batsman Hales made 112 in an England total of 236 all out after the tourists were sent in to bat in the series decider.His second one day international century capped a fine series for the tall Hales who had made fifties in each of the previous four matches including an innings of 99 in the second game in Port Elizabeth.He finished the series with 383 runs at an average of 76.60. Hales had minimal support from the rest of the England batsmen however with Joe Root (27) and Ben Stokes (29) the only others to reach 20.Hales and Root put on 61 for the second wicket   their fifth successive partnership of 50 or more   before Root was trapped leg before wicket by leg spinner Imran Tahir.Root made 351 runs in the series at an average of 70.20. Tahir took the first two wickets dismissing Jason Roy leg before after being brought on in the fifth over and finishing off the innings by having Stuart Broad caught at mid off.Tahir took three for 53. Kagiso Rabada and David Wiese also took three wickets each for 34 and 50 runs respectively.South African captain AB de Villiers sent England in to bat after early morning rain but although it was slow the pitch did not appear to help the bowlers unduly.
