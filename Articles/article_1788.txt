Heading: English cricket board promises help for Amirs UK vi

Article: LONDON: The spokesperson for the England and Wales Cricket Board stated that they were in contact with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) with regard to the pacer's visa problem. According to details, the spokesperson said that Pakistani fast bowler Mohommad Amir's visa application fell under the purview of the Immigration department. We are in touch with PCB and would provide them with any help they need, the spokesperson said. Pakistani fast bowler Mohommad Amir had applied for a visa to the United Kingdom on Friday, for Pakistan's upcoming tour of England. Amir had been found guilty with then-Pakistani skipper Salman Butt and pacer Muhammad Asif on spot-fixing charges. If the young, fiery bowler is granted his UK visa, then this would mean that Amir would mark his first tour to England after his infamous spot-fixing scandal. "I have written a letter to the high commissioner seeking special and sympathetic consideration on Amirs visa," PCB chief Shaharyar Khan had said. "The England and Wales Cricket Board is also assisting and are in touch with their home department, so we hope for a positive response."This would also be Pakistan cricket team's first tour of England after 2010. The impressive 24-year old left arm pacer has already played in New Zealand immediately after he returned to international cricket a couple of months ago. It is pertinent to note here that Amir could be banned from touring England, in light of his 2010 spot-fixing conviction.
