Heading: Misbah out for nought as England fight b

Article: LONDON: Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq followed his first-innings hundred with a duck as England fought back on the third day of the first Test at Lord´s on Saturday.At tea, Pakistan were 111 for four in their second innings -- a lead of 178 runs.A becalmed Younis Khan, who played several exaggerated leave shots, was 19 not out off 86 balls.But Asad Shafiq had kept the scoreboard ticking over with an unbeaten 29 off 46 balls including five boundaries.Saturday´s second session saw England all-rounder Chris Woakes follow his Test-best six for 70 in the first innings with two wickets.Pakistan were 40 for one at lunch after Mohammad Hafeez had carelessly fallen for a duck in cutting Stuart Broad straight to Joe Root at second slip.But they lost opener Shan Masood soon afterwards when the left-hander, once more fallible outside off stump, flat-footedly edged Warwickshire paceman Woakes to England captain Alastair Cook at first slip.Azhar Ali (23) then fell lbw to a desperately tight umpire´s call as Woakes reduced Pakistan to 59 for three.Misbah, in his maiden Test knock at Lord´s, had made 114 in Pakistan´s first innings.But on Saturday he fell for nought when he hoisted off-spinner Moeen Ali legside and Alex Hales, running round to the mid-wicket rope, held a good catch.Pakistan had never previously lost a Test when Misbah had made a hundred and never won one when he had made a duck.With conditions set fair on a sunny day at Lord´s and more than two days left in the match, something had to give.Younis, on 11, was given out lbw by umpire Joel Wilson after a prolonged and theatrical appeal from fast bowler Steven Finn on his Middlesex home ground. But a review showed the ball missing leg stump and Younis survived.Earlier, leg-spinner Yasir Shah took six wickets as England were bowled out for 272 -- 67 runs behind on first innings.Shah´s haul of six for 72 was the best return by a visiting spinner against England at Lord´s since Sid Pegler´s seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912. <br/> Variations in pace and flight saw Shah repeatedly pose problems on an unresponsive pitch.If Pakistan´s batsmen could give him enough runs to play with in a second innings, Shah was likely to be an even greater threat on a wearing surface.
