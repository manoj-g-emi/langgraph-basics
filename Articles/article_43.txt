After the incident, we also held 50 Indian trucks on Pakistani Kashmir side, because traffic crosses the border simultaneously," said Iqbal.Imtiaz Wayen, director-general of Pakistani Kashmir´s trade and travel authority, said India was not entitled to stop Pakistani drivers on grounds of smuggling."According to our agreement, if they find any banned item in our trucks they are bound to hand over that item and the relevant truck driver to us for further action," he said.
