Heading: Li maintains Chinese grip on China O

Article: BEIJING: Li Haotong kept the China Open title in local hands for the second year in a row by conjuring up his best round of the week, a bogey-free 64, to clinch his maiden European Tour title by three shots on Sunday.The 20-year-old Hunanese began the final round two shots behind overnight leaders Felipe Aguilar (69) and Lucas Bjerregaard (70) but carded a blemish-free round for a winning total of 22-under at the Topwin Golf and Country Club.Li became followed in the footsteps of Wu Ashun, who became the third Chinese winner of the country´s oldest professional tournament last year.He sank his eighth and final birdie on the penultimate hole and was already at 22-under when Aguilar´s tee shot on the 16th found water, the double bogey putting paid to the Chilean´s title hopes.Li said he was aware of the lead only on the 18th fairway and thanked his caddy for helping him not to get carried away by his aggressive approach."When I had my tee-shot, I walked to my second shot there and I was thinking I need to go hybrid to get to the front edge to give me an easy chip to there but my caddy said, ´Haotong, you´re already three shots in the lead, you´ve just got to lay up and make par to win´. So thanks to him!" he said.The victory was a big relief for Li, who lost out in a play-off at the Shenzhen International last year and missed the cut at Genzon Golf Club last week."The start of this year has given me a lot of hard times," he said.<br/> "Even though I worked hard I still played badly, especially last week.<br/> I worked hard there and couldn´t control my ball."I just tried to relax myself and I´m really really happy to hold the trophy here."Aguilar finished 19-under, a shot ahead of Dane Bjerregaard, Englishman Richard Bland and German Marcel Siem.
