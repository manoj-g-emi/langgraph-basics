Heading: Gold hits 13 month top on firm eur

Article: strong>MANILA: Gold climbed to a 13-month high on Friday, buoyed by gains in the euro after the European Central Bank (ECB) signalled it was done cutting interest rates for now.</strongThe ECB on Thursday rolled out measures, including an expansion in asset buying and a deeper cut to deposit rates.But the euro hit a three-week top, and held near that level on Friday, after ECB President Mario Draghi signalled there would be no further rate cuts.Spot gold rose as far as $1,282.51 an ounce, its strongest since Feb. 3, 2015, and was trading at $1,277.20 by 0237 GMT, up 0.5 percent.Bullion climbed 1.5 percent on Thursday, its biggest single-day gain in a week, and was on course for a second weekly rise.For the year, gold has added more than 20 percent.US gold for April delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $1,277.60 an ounce, after peaking at $1,287.80.The next major resistance level for gold would be around $1,308, reached in January last year, said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney."Ultimately if this trend continues, we may well see ourselves up towards $1,400 in gold," he said.The relatively weak US dollar, despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates this year, as well as concerns about a wobbly global economy should support gold prices going forward, said Spooner."Gold remains our preferred commodity/sector in view of increasing liquidity from global monetary easing," Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau wrote in a research note.Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world´s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose to 25.68 million ounces on Thursday, the highest since August 2014.With the metal clinging to this year´s gains, physical gold demand slowed in top consumer China this week, while a strike by jewellers protesting against the imposition of a tax curbed demand in No.2 market India.Spot silver gained 0.4 percent to $15.65 an ounce, platinum advanced 0.8 percent to $983.35 and palladium was steady at $570.
