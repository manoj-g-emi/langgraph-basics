Heading: Tearful Bairstow enjoys best day of his lif

Article: strong>CAPE TOWN: Jonny Bairstow pumped his chest to the sky and wiped away a tear as he completed an emotional maiden test hundred for England against South Africa on Sunday, amid a record-breaking stand with Ben Stokes.</strongThe red-haired England wicketkeeper last year lost his grandfather, with whom he shared a close relationship, while his dad David, a former England cricketer, killed himself in 1998.Obviously after everything that has gone on in the last year or so its fantastic to get over the line for me and my family, he told reporters after finishing on 150 not out with his mother and sister watching on from the stands. They have supported me all through my career. To have them here in Cape Town is lovely and it is my mums birthday on the last day of the test so hopefully we can cap off a great game. It was probably the best day of my life and one I will never forget.After being recalled to the England side during last years Ashes triumph over Australia, Bairstow's place in the team has come under scrutiny. "It has been a little while coming. There was a lot of talk here and there so Im delighted to get over the line today, he said.Stokes and Bairstow scored 399 in a record sixth-wicket stand as England declared on 629 for six on the second day of the second test at Newlands.It was a bludgeoning performance from Stokes, who scored a record-breaking 258 off 198 balls."It was an exhibition of stroke play," Bairstow said. "We just clicked in and supported each other all the way through. To play a knock like that is something quite spectacular.Ive grown up with Stokesy and seen him play some fantastic knocks and to witness that today was extremely special and something a lot of people will never forget. England will seek to take an even firmer hold on the test on Monday by quickly dismissing South Africa, who closed on 141 for two."It will be a strong move from us if we can come back in the morning and take some chances," Bairstow said. Our bowlers have a wealth of experience in all different conditions and hopefully we can come out tomorrow, utilise a bit of reverse swing, moisture in the pitch and we go from there."
