Article: strong>LAHORE: Pakistani cricketer and former captain of the national side Salman Butt said that it was now time to forget about the spot-fixing saga and move on. </strongSpeaking to Geo News, the Pakistani cricketer said that the controversy that had erupted six years earlier at Lords should now be forgotten. He said negative elements were highlighting the issue time and again in order to worry the Pakistan team. "It is time to move forward now since all who were involved in the case have completed their sentences," he said.Butt's statement comes ahead of Pakistan's first tour of England after six years. The last time the two sides met, Salman Butt was the captain of the national side which had been rocked with the spot-fixing saga. Ultimately, Butt, Asif and Amir were found guilty of being involved in spot-fixing. All three players served five-year bans after being found guilty of bowling deliberate no-balls against England in the Lords test match six years ago. A couple of days ago, English batsman Kevin Pietersen had called for banning Mohommad Amir for life. <br/><br/>"People always deserve a second chance in life but sport is different. We are paid to play a sport we love and are damn lucky to lead the life of a professional cricketer. To try and gain an advantage by taking drugs or devaluing your sport by being bribed is breaking the 11th and 12th commandments. There can be no way back," Pietersen had said. Pakistan clash against England on 14th July in the first of the four-match test series. The first test match is scheduled to take place at Lords.
