Heading: Zimbabwe crumble to 126 after Sibanda fifty

Article: HARARE: India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal picked up three wickets as Zimbabwe were bowled out for a paltry 126 in the second one-day international at Harare Sports Club on Monday.Chahal overcame a brief onslaught from Vusi Sibanda to trigger a dramatic Zimbabwe collapse, which saw the hosts lose five wickets for the addition of just six runs.Sibanda´s positive strokeplay had taken Zimbabwe to a promising 106 for three after they had lost the toss and been sent in to bat, but Chahal picked up the wickets of Sikandar Raza, Elton Chigumbura and Sibanda in the space of nine deliveries.Zimbabwe´s cause was not helped by the fact that Sean Williams was unable to bat.After being named as a replacement for the injured Craig Ervine, Williams was hit on the finger whilst warming up and sent for an X-ray.Chahal finished with figures of 3 for 25 from six overs, while seamers Barinder Sran and Dhawal Kulkarni picked up a couple of wickets apiece.Sibanda´s 53 was the top score for Zimbabwe.India lead the three-match series 1-0 after winning the first ODI by nine wickets.
