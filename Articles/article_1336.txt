Heading: Sarfraz helps Pakistan set 130 run target for Banglad

Article: DHAKA: Sarfraz Ahmed along with Shoaib Malik saved Pakistan from a total collapse against Bangladesh in the eighth Twenty20 International of the Asia Cup here at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, Mirpur on Wednesday.After captain Shahid Afridi won the toss and decided to bat first, Pakistan once again made a disastrous start and lost four wickets for just 28 runs in a match which is a do-or-die battle for them.However, Sarfraz and Shoaib came to rescue and took out the team from trouble, adding 70 valuable runs for the fifth wicket stand before the latter departed at the score of 98.He made 41from 30 balls with a six and five fours and then a big slogging was expected from captain Afridi but he disappointed as he lifted the ball only to give a catch at the boundary-line.Meanwhile Sarfraz completed his glorious fifty from 40 balls and with Anwar Ali took Pakistan to a reasonable total of 129 for seven.However, it was Pakistans lowest total in eight T20 Internationals played earlier against Bangladesh. The previous lowest was 135.Sarfraz hammered an unbeaten 58 from 42 balls with two mighty sixes and five forceful boundaries while Anwar remained not out on 13.For Bangladesh, pacer Al-Amin Hossain captured three wickets for 25 and Arafat Sunny claimed two for 35.   This is a do-or-die battle for Pakistan while the hosts, Bangladesh, have an opportunity to secure their berth in the final.Tamim Iqbal returned to the Bangladesh XI after completing his paternity leave in Bangkok. He replaced Nurul Hasan, while the injured Mustafizur Rahman was replaced by Arafat Sunny. Mushfiqur Rahim took over the keeping gloves for the game.Pakistan made one change, bringing in pace bowler Anwar Ali in place of left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz who made his T20I debut against UAE.
