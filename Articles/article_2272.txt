Heading: Pakistan celebrate Test win with press ups military salu

Article: strong>LONDON: Pakistan celebrated their victory over England in the first Test at Lord´s on Sunday by performing a series of press-ups although defeated skipper Alistair Cook admitted it wasn´t pleasant viewing.</strongMisbah-ul-Haq´s side went on an army boot camp before the tour to improve their infamously poor fitness, and senior batsman Younis Khan led the squad in performing a routine of press-ups followed by a military-style salute in front of the ground´s famous Pavilion.Misbah, 42, had celebrated in similar fashion on the opening day on Thursday after reaching a hundred that helped set up his team´s 75-run win."The team was really hoping that we get a chance, because I got a chance after scoring a hundred," said Misbah, the oldest man to score a Test hundred in 82 years, of his press-up celebration."I did that and everybody wanted to do that. That sends a small tribute to all those army men who were working really hard (with us)."England captain Alastair Cook, asked for his views on Pakistan´s unusual post-match display, said: "You don´t take any offence, but certainly at that emotive time it´s not pleasant viewing."Certainly when you´ve lost a game of cricket for the first 20 minutes or so it´s not pleasant.""They (Pakistan) are entitled to do what they want. It´s united them and shows what a challenge we´ve got."But Cook, speaking ahead of next week´s second Test in Manchester. "Hopefully the cricketing gods might (turn in our favour at Old Trafford)."
